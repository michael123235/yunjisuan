        "text": "Born and raised in the Philippines, Lea Salonga grew up watching Disney movies and listening to Disney storybook tapes. Never did she imagine, though, that she would grow up to be a real-life, bona fide Disney Princess.\n\nThen, after earning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Kim in the Broadway musical “Miss Saigon” in 1991, Salonga landed the career break of a lifetime: to be the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in the 1992 hit Disney film “Aladdin.”\n\nSix years later, she got a second chance to live her young girl’s dream as she performed the vocals of Mulan in the 1998 Disney film of that name.\n\n“I never thought when I was 5 and listening to ‘Cinderella’ stories that I’d be a Disney princess. I think it’s such a magical thing to happen in my life, and for it to happen twice is something I would never have thought could happen,” said Salonga in a recent phone interview.\n\nSalonga’s distinctive voice will return to Southern California for concerts tonight at the Valley Performing Arts Center in Northridge and Saturday at Segerstrom Center for the Arts. Backed by a four-piece band, Salonga will perform a selection of well-known songs, including her greatest hits from her various musicals and films.\n\n“We made sure to choose a fun program that the band is going to dig playing and I’m going to love singing,” said Salonga, “and because we are having so much fun onstage, I hope that translates to the audience as well.”\n\nSalonga is keeping the program’s song selections a secret for now, until she and her musical director decide on the set list; however, she promises all of the tunes will be familiar and fit her vocal range. Some of the songs, she added, will be making their California debut.\n\n“This will be the first time for California audiences to hear these songs, but there is nothing unknown or out of left field; stuff that always makes sense with my voice.”\n\nA regular feature of Salonga’s solo concerts is an audience participation segment, in which she chooses someone to join her onstage to sing the Grammy and Academy Award-winning duet “A Whole New World” from “Aladdin.”\n\n“No need to panic; we always have a lyric sheet so anyone who dares to come up doesn’t have to have it memorized fully,” she said. “I want them to have fun.”\n\nSalonga has numerous Broadway credits, including her role as Eponine in the 1993 “Les Misérables” Broadway run and as Fantine in the 2006 Broadway revival. She recently came off Broadway in the new musical “Allegiance,” which also starred George Takei and Telly Leung.\n\nSplitting her time between the U.S. and Manila, Salonga is a coach on the Philippine version of the television show “The Voice.” In addition to her onscreen and onstage career, she has released several solo albums, including “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing” (1997) and “By Heart” (1999).\n\nOn this tour, Grammy-nominated bass player Trey Henry and drummer Ray Brinker, both from the jazz group Tierney Sutton Band, will back Salonga.\n\n“I get to go up onstage with musicians who I really admire and respect, and just have a great time with,” Salonga said. “It’s thrilling when I get to perform stuff where I can just emotionally let go and fly off to another world in my mind, and the audience gets to ride on that too.”\n\nContact the writer: jmoe@ocregister.com",

        "text": "Ed Sheeran has come to a deal to end a $20 million copyright infringement lawsuit brought by two songwriters, Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, over his hit, “Photograph.”\n\nOn Friday, court papers were filed dismissing the case with prejudice, but also stipulating that a California federal court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of an agreement.\n\nAlthough the parties including co-defendants Sony/ATV and Warner Music didn’t disclose the nature of the settlement terms in a court filing, songwriting credits in the BMI database now have added Harrington and Leonard as co-authors along with Sheeran and Johnny McDaid. What’s more, it appears that the two plaintiffs have gained a significant share of royalties. Before the lawsuit, 100 percent of the work was controlled by BMI, which administers the public performance of McDaid’s works, but now that percentage has dropped to 82.5 percent as Leonard has an ASCAP affiliation.\n\nHarrington and Leonard, along with their publishing company HaloSongs, filed the lawsuit in June 2016, alleging that “Photograph” derived from their 2009 work “Amazing,” which was recorded and released as a single by Matt Cardle, the winner of the 2010 season of the television competition show The X Factor. They were represented in court by Richard Busch, the attorney who prevailed at trial on behalf of the Marvin Gaye family in the copyright lawsuit over “Blurred Lines.”\n\nThe complaint, which charged “verbatim, note-for-note copying,” and included sheet music to prove it, was initially challenged on pleading standards and jurisdiction, but in January a judge let it move forward.\n\nThe defendants were represented by Michael Niborski and Ilene Farkas at Pryor Cashman.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect new information from BMI’s database.",

        "text": "Alec Baldwin is one of the most recognizable and now, with his Donald Trump impersonation, one of the most beloved actors in America. He originated the role of Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red October (1990) and had an iconic seven-year run as Jack Donaghy on the sitcom 30 Rock. He’s hosted Saturday Night Live more times than anyone else (17) and has been a tabloid target for his acrimonious divorce from Kim Basinger and angry outbursts at his own daughter and at the paparazzi following him around.\n\nNow in Nevertheless (Harper, available today), Baldwin, 59, tells his story for the first time, from his Long Island childhood to his early stardom (and trouble with drugs) to his current renaissance. From the revelations about his drug use to the actors and directors he hates (Harrison Ford, Oliver Stone) and loves (Tina Fey, of course), here are the 10 most interesting things to learn in the book:\n\n1. He’s a lot more like Donald Trump than he lets on.\n\nNot in their politics, of course; Baldwin is as much an old-school liberal Democrat as you’ll find. And not in their humanity, either. For all his faults — and they are many — Baldwin is ultimately a much kinder, decent, more humane person than Trump, if for no other reason than the actor is pretty self-aware about his flaws and genuinely contrite for some of his worst behavior (like that infamous 2007 screaming voicemail left for daughter Ireland). But in other ways, ways that I suspect helps Baldwin play Trump, they are similar. Both are men of great appetites (figuratively speaking). The people they love, they really love. The people they hate, they really hate. Both are easy to anger. Both hold grudges for a long time (see below about Ford and ex-wife Basinger as evidence). Both have daddy issues, trying to live up to what they imagine are the expectations of their larger-than-life fathers (Fred Trump the developer, Alex Baldwin, Jr. the beloved history teacher). And both are homebodies deeply shaped by their New York youth (Queens for Trump, Long Island for Baldwin).\n\n2. He almost killed himself with drugs and booze in the 1980s.\n\nIn the first blush of fame in the early ‘80s, Baldwin became addicted to cocaine and booze and almost died of an overdose while shooting a Knots Landing episode in Oregon, ending up in the hospital for 36 hours. His first crack at AA didn’t stick and he relapsed at the end of 1984. The second try stuck and Baldwin has been sober since Feb. 23, 1985.\n\n3. He’s still angry at Kim Basinger, but sorry about that voicemail.\n\nBaldwin’s 1993 marriage to the actress devolved into an acrimonious divorce in 2002 and a continuing custody battle over daughter Ireland. He’s still bitter about it and her role in 2007 in leaking the infamous angry voicemail where he called Ireland a pig, among other things. But he’s contrite about the voicemail itself. He writes that his relationship with Ireland has healed, but the incident “permanently harmed” their bond.\n\n4. He doesn’t like Harrison Ford.\n\nOne of Baldwin’s breakout movie roles was as Jack Ryan in Hunt for Red October, but when it came time to negotiate a deal for the sequel, he learned the studio was talking to Ford to replace him behind his back. Hunt for Red October director John McTiernan asked Ford if backstabbing Baldwin bothered him. Ford’s reply? “F— him.” Baldwin writes, “He was playing a different game. In the need of the next franchise to keep the flame of his stardom burning bright while earning him tens of millions more, what choice did he have? The carpenter who walked onto a set [Star Wars] and then into movie history knew that these roles were his legacy.”\n\n5. …or Oliver Stone.\n\nBaldwin made Talk Radio with the director and does not mince words about how much he disliked the 1988 experience: “Stone’s ‘technique’ was to generate as much tension on the set as he believed the film required. With sarcastic asides and a passive-aggressive tone throughout, Stone drove the cast and crew to drink a lot.”\n\n6. …or even his own work.\n\nDespite a career that has lasted over 30 years and includes over 120 credits, Baldwin doesn’t think much of his own work. He writes that “the final ten minutes of The Edge are the only piece of my own film work I can ever watch and enjoy.” State and Main “is one of the few of my own movies that I can stand watching.” 30 Rock, though, made an impression on him, more than his graduating from high school or college. “When 30 Rock ended, all of the feelings one associates with the end of something seminal — feelings that I had missed or squandered earlier, that comes from truly investing in an experience — finally came out. That was my graduation.”\n\n7. But he has high praise for other co-stars and actors.\n\nHe fell in love with Michelle Pfeiffer — like everyone else who met her then — during the making of Married to the Mob. Ben Affleck is a “prince.” Miami Blues co-star Jennifer Jason Leigh is a great actor. Matt Damon has “warmth and humanity.” He loved his one day on the set Notting Hill because, “I got to breathe the same air as the remarkable Julia Roberts.”\n\n8. His love of Tina Fey rules all (but he didn’t think much of her husband at first).\n\n“When I first met Tina Fey — beautiful and brunette, smart and funny, by turns smug and diffident and completely uninterested in me or anything I had to say — I had the same reaction that I’m sure many men and women have: I fell in love.” And then Saturday Night Live’s talent coordinator Marci Klein introduced him to Fey’s “travel size” husband Jeff Richmond, leading Baldwin to think: “What’s she doing with him?”\n\n8. Anthony Hopkins does a mean Richard Burton impersonation.\n\nOn the set of 1997’s The Edge, the two actors amused themselves with dueling impersonations of the legendary actor (and Elizabeth Taylor spouse). “The goal was to not only impersonate Burton but to distill the self-destructive genius down to his essence.” Hopkins killed it: “Tony won the game for all time with his almost haiku-like incantation: ‘Elizabeth! Baubles and stones. White wine. Marbella.’ Then he feigned passing out.”\n\n9. His wife Hilaria nails him for his narcissism and has maybe the best line in the book.\n\n“When I’m not with you, I still exist.”\n\n10. Is he running for office?\n\nBaldwin has long denied that he’d run for office, squashing speculation about runs for mayor of New York City, governor, senator or even president. And he repeats it in the book, but one chapter reads like a campaign manifesto where he criticizes voter suppression and Middle East policy, explores why Hillary Clinton lost and offers some thoughts on what a president should do.",

A second source told the site, “They all just think it’s stupid that they’re bringing people from outside the franchise instead of bringing the OG’s and the Teen Mom 2 cast together. Maci Bookout loves Chelsea Houska, Kailyn Lowry and Amber get along, it just makes more sense.”\n\nSource: MTV\n\nThe insider added how Tyler is “fed up with all the drama the show has brought them.” Adding, “He just doesn’t think the show is going to last very much longer unless the new cast member brings in amazing ratings, but they aren’t really holding their breath.\" Catelynn \"feels like the show has absolutely nothing to do with the kids anymore so they’re just waiting for MTV to pull the plug.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MTV\n\nAs fans watched, Farrah was fired from the show for her involvement in the adult entertainment video industry, as well as her attitude towards the crew. “No reaction,” she told Radar about how she feels about her replacement. “I don’t watch the show anymore as I’ve moved on. The show was done when I left.”\n\nSource: MTV\n\nDespite most cast members not being happy with the new member, one person has a different opinion! “Cory Wharton is my guy so I’m glad he’s on board,” Javi Marroquin said to the site. “Good decision for his family.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MTV\n\nAs previously reported, Cheyenne has a one-year-old daughter, Ryder.\n\nSource: MTV\n\nShe shares her daughter with The Challenge star Cory.

And the Southern Charm mom was certainly feeling the pressure of having to relive every moment viewers watched of her life during last season's sit-down. So when it came time to film the Season 4 reunion, she went into the event with a very different mind frame.\n\nHow to Watch Watch Southern Charm on Bravo Thursdays at 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Bravo App.\n\n\"I’m hoping to express a little less than I did last year, but you know. I don’t know; I’m just hoping that people can see that through out all of this you can’t make me tick. That is what people push me to do,\" she explained to The Daily Dish. \"They’re waiting on me to stress out enough to where I crack or something. And I want to show them that they can’t do that anymore.\"\n\nRelated\n\nPart 1 of the Season 4 reunion put Kathryn in the hot seat, with the Charleston native having to open up about why she went to rehab as well as her life as a mom (she has two kids with ex, Thomas Ravenel) and her former friendship with Jennifer Snowden. And she knew that when it came to having to face the tough questions and issues, she wanted to deal with it in a different way than she's done in the past. \"So, they’re probably expecting — or not knowing what to expect when they see me, but that’s a good thing 'cause I’m gonna surprise them I think,\" she said.\n\nAs for last year's outfit, well, Kathryn doesn't look to fondly on that. \"Fashion, what is it? Flop. Ugh, it was bad, but I mean it was cute but all in a different outfit,\" she reflected. \"Like the top with something else, the bottom with something else. I don’t know. But this year I love my dress. It’s like badass basically is what I’m trying to get at.\"\n\nKathryn at the Season 4 reunion vs. Kathryn at the Season 3 reunion.\n\nCheck out Part 2 of the reunion next Monday at 8/7c.

        "text": "It’s been well over a year since Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room. The violent attack, which happened on Oct. 3, 2016, took an emotional and psychological toll on Kardashian and her family. Even her husband Kanye West is still grappling with the after-effects of the incident. While he wasn’t with his wife at the moment the robbery happened, Kanye West’s reaction to Kim Kardashian’s Paris robbery is quite sad and really speaks to the depth of his love for her.\n\nIn an all-new interview with radio personality Charlamagne tha God, West spoke at length about a variety of topics, including his mental health, therapy, Twitter, and Kardashian’s robbery.\n\nIn the interview, West talked about feeling hopeless in light of his wife’s Paris misfortune:\n\nYou're feeling, like, helpless, like what can you do? … I went to Paris on that trip to protect her. Not protect her physically, but to just go and help her with her looks because she's in Paris. So I'm like, 'Let me put my eye on it personally.'\n\nThe famed rapper left to be at his wife’s side in the middle of a set during the Meadows Music and Arts Festival in New York. He cited a “family emergency” at the time and promptly took his leave.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nDuring his interview with Charlamagne tha God, West also talked about how Kardashian’s assailants plotted against her and waited for him to be out the picture:\n\nOne of the things she said that she heard was they were coming to rob her and they had to wait until I had left. The people had been strategizing and scheming on that for a long time. So when she probably got to Paris by herself, they were like 'This is our chance.' The next thing you know, I get off the flight the next day, and they were like, 'Oh, OK, we gotta like fall back.' And then when I left a couple days later — I almost stayed — I hear, my friend comes up to me and says 'Your wife was robbed.'\n\nIt sounds as if West feels a bit of regret about not staying by Kardashian’s side during that trip, which is super sad. Ultimately, the whole ordeal isn’t West’s fault, but that he still feels the sting of it really shows how much the incident impacted him.\n\nKardashian herself has been exceptionally outspoken about the incident, often relaying the details of the robbery for talk shows, interviews, and social media. In an Instagram post from March 2017, Kardashian shared a few words ahead of an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians that revolved around the robbery:\n\nTonight's episode is going to be very tough for me. However, I thought it was important to share this story through my eyes & not in an interview where my own words could be twisted. I have always shared so much & I'm not going to hold back when this was probably one of the most life changing experiences for me. I would never wish this experience upon anyone, but have learned some valuable lessons & feel so blessed to be safe home with my babies & husband. To my friends, family, and loved ones I can't thank you enough for being there when I needed you the most. To the French police, thank you for your incredible hard work.\n\nAlthough the violent robbery had a profound effect on West and Kardashian, it seems that they’ve really pulled through and are stronger than ever. Kardashian has frequently said that she’s a better person because of what happened. And there’s absolutely no doubt that her relationship with West and her children is strengthened because of that.\n\nThe road to healing after such a traumatic event is long, but Kardashian and West are well on their way.",

        "text": "Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck were close to finalizing their divorce in the weeks leading up to his return to rehab, multiple sources tell PEOPLE.\n\nThe former couple, both 46, first announced their separation in June 2015 and later officially filed for divorce in April 2017. Almost a year and a half after filing, the two were close to a final settlement before Affleck returned to treatment on Wednesday with Garner’s help.\n\nAnother source close to the couple says the two are still “working on” the divorce: “They’ve spent quite some time figuring out what works best for them and their family.”\n\nA source told PEOPLE in the days before the rehab trip that Garner was mostly concerned about how finalizing their divorce would affect their three children — Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.\n\n“Her number one concern is the kids,” the source said, noting that Garner struggles with questions like, “Is Ben healthy enough to have custody?” Added the source: “What she ultimately cares about is his sobriety and whether she can rely on him to co-parent.”\n\nWATCH: Ben Affleck Enters Rehab for Third Time as ‘Visibly Upset’ Jennifer Garner Drives Him to Treatment\n\nIn early August, an L.A. court advised Garner and Affleck that their divorce case could be dismissed “for delay in prosecution” if they fail to proceed and provide necessary documents.\n\nHowever, a source told PEOPLE at the time, “there is no rush here. They continue to figure out ways of working together as a family and this is what works for them.”\n\nJason Merritt/Getty\n\nSince filing, the former couple have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately. In the meantime, they have continued to co-parent their kids and earlier this year spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck was shooting his new movie Triple Frontier. They were also seen on a family trip to a Broadway show last month.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in need of help, please contact the SAMHSA substance abuse helpline at 1-800-662-HELP.",

        "text": "In 1969, a nun in Baltimore went missing. Two months later, her body was found. Her name was Sister Cathy Cesnik. She was a beloved 26-year-old teacher at the local Archbishop Keough High School, and her death left the community confounded: Who would want to hurt this woman? Decades later, the case is still unsolved—but the circumstances around it have grown wild and complex, with police desperate to determine if Cesnik’s death had anything to do with a major sexual abuse scandal at the school. What did she know? And who, ultimately, used that information against her?\n\nThe mysterious murder is coming to light this spring thanks to Netflix, which is releasing a seven-part docu-series about Cesnik’s death titled The Keepers. A new trailer, released on People, is giving true-crime fans a first look at the series, and is already striking an ominous, conspiratorial tone.\n\nThe trailer’s main action is led by locals who knew Sister Cathy, particularly two former students who have never stopped trying to solve the devastating murder. After Cesnik’s death, many quickly linked her case to the alleged covered-up sexual-abuse scandal by priest Father Joseph Maskell, who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of school girls. He later paid settlements to his accusers, per People.\n\nBut two of the accusers, Jean Wehner and Teresa Lancaster, decided to participate in the Netflix documentary, directed by Ryan White. The series digs into the allegations, attempting to untangle the dark web Maskell—whom White describes as a “sociopath”—allegedly weaved, and trying to bring to light all the insidious participants who helped him get away it.\n\n“This is a story of accountability and, at best, dozens of people and institutions dropped the ball and didn’t protect children and adults,” White tells People. “At worst, dozens of people and institutions covered things up so it could never be brought to light or were directly involved in crimes.”\n\nHe adds that while many of the alleged perpetrators, including Maskell, died before being brought to justice, “there are people still alive who I do believe need to be held accountable.”\n\nTrue-crime stories have always been at the forefront of pop culture, but there’s been a boom in recent years, thanks to the explosive success of podcasts like Serial, HBO’s series The Jinx, and Netflix’s own Making a Murderer. However, retelling crime stories often presents a problem when it comes to finding a fitting ending. Serial, for example, had an amazing run, but ended on a “You be the judge” note that left many grasping for a more concrete finale. But though White was never focused on solving the murder of Sister Cathy, he feels strongly that the ending of this docu-series, unlike many true crime stories before it, will be promising: “I finished this project thinking this murder can be solved.”",

Wishing an audience member happy birthday, Styles asked how old she was turning, to which the fan replied, \"22.\" It's not hard to guess what happened next.\n\nAnnouncing the news to the audience, Styles said, \"22. She’s 22, okay? I don’t know about...\" And as every Swift fan knows, that's exactly how the lyrics to \"22\" go. You can watch the whole interaction on Twitter:\n\nUnfortunately, Styles didn't launch into a full-on cover of \"22,\" although he should definitely consider doing so in a future set.\n\nStyles and Swift started dating in November 2012, and were photographed together for the first time in December the same year, when they were spotted in Central Park. Perez Hilton reported their breakup on January 7, 2013, with a source revealing, \"They are both really busy and never in one place for long. Harry's really upset about the split and is really sensitive about it.\" They both went on to write songs about each other.\n\nthe tea is that harry will never forget taylor as long as he lives as well pic.twitter.com/jyutkmDj95March 19, 2018 See more\n\nme: i'm over haylor now they're both in separate relationships and it's been yearsharry: taylorme: HELLO BITCH!March 19, 2018 See more\n\nPerhaps the best things that Swift has bestowed upon the world are the copious references to ex-boyfriends that she's scattered throughout her discography. Instead of having to rely on gossip and paparazzi photos, fans of the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" singer can relive every relationship she's had via intimate song lyrics, and hidden album liner notes. And clearly, Styles loves Swift's work as much as the rest of us.",

        "text": "The father of one of the world's biggest stars has waded into the immigration debate.\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS\n\nIn recent months, hundreds of migrants have been relocated to a dormitory on New York City's Upper West Side where, according to restaurateur Joe Germanotta — better known as Grammy and Oscar winner Lady Gaga's dad — residents' quality of life has been going downhill. Joe — who's lived in the affluent area, along with wife Cynthia, for 35 years and also owns and runs Joanne Trattoria eatery there — spoke to the New York Post to explain his stance.\n\nAs he tells it in a story published on Aug. 9, the problems started six weeks earlier when NYC turned the Stratford Arms Hotel — which had been a residence hall for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and is just down the block from Joe's home — into a shelter for 500 migrants. \"It was a stealth operation. They were bused in the middle of the night, like when they flew them into Westchester, they didn't want anybody to know what was going on,\" he shared. \"It was all pretty rapid.\"\n\nHe said that the migrants have been throwing block parties outside their hotel that run into the early morning hours, that people are recklessly riding e-bikes and scooters on one-way streets and that evidence of prostitution has emerged. Girls as young as 14 are getting catcalled and residents are dealing with verbal abuse too, he alleged. There's also trash piling up on what used to be clean streets. It's all causing property values to drop and leaving residents feeling helpless, Joe explained. \"They're guests in our neighborhood and they have basically taken over,\" he said.\n\nJoe Schildhorn/BFA/Shutterstock\n\n\"Hookers are coming and going. In the mornings, you see prostitutes coming out of the building,\" he said, adding that \"the worst part's at night\" because of \"the noise,\" which \"starts at about 10 o'clock\" and goes \"until 4 in the morning.\" Joe also said they're \"playing music and racing their motocross and motorbikes up and down the streets.\"\n\nIf things were like this when Joe was raising his daughters — Lady Gaga (real name: Stefani Germanotta) and Natali Germanotta — \"I wouldn't be living in New York,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the businessman, \"The dormitory students at the school, the American Music and Dance Academy, were given two weeks' notice that they had to get out, and none of the residents in the neighborhood were given any notice about the migrant shelter.\" He believes that about 500 migrants are living in 400 rooms that are only large enough for a bed and refrigerator and that everyone is sharing bathrooms — a typical college dorm setup.\n\nDonna Ward/Getty Images\n\nJoe made it clear that his issue is not that the migrants are in his neighborhood. It's that the city isn't dealing with the issues that have emerged nor is there a plan to restore order, he claimed. \"I think, for the most part, the 500 that are in there are good people,\" Joe explained. \"And I think they're locked into very small rooms and when they get out, they go out at night, and they party.\"\n\nHe added, \"I don't mind having them there. They're gonna be there for three years. That was the contract, I understand. But at least manage it. Put the proper security in place, have a police presence and a code of conduct.\"\n\nJoe is the board president of his building and, along with other neighboring residences, is lobbying City Hall for better policing and supervision while the migrants are there. He also has some advice for NYC's mayor: \"In my opinion, you should have just suspended 'sanctuary city' status until we had enough housing and then said, 'Yeah, OK, you can send some more,'\" Joe told the Post. \"It's a joke. Why doesn't he get one of the cruise ships? The cruise ships hold more people, and it's a more controlled environment. The city is spending a tremendous amount of money that could be spent towards building affordable housing.\"\n\n",

        "text": "Even before FX’s Feud premiered, series creator Ryan Murphy teased how the mini-series would end for Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, the beleaguered Hollywood legends played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon.\n\n“I have always had a wistful dream that Bette and Joan could have watched this [show] together,” Murphy told Vanity Fair of the star-crossed friends. “I think that my favorite line from What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? is at the end of the film, when Jane tells Blanche, just as she is dying, ‘You mean all this time, we could have been friends?’ To me, that’s what the whole show is about.”\n\nMurphy was so serious about the sentiment that he used it for the title of his finale: “You Mean All This Time We Could Have Been Friends?” And, as he hinted he might, Murphy found a way to reimagine a better outcome for his protagonists. Crawford, nearing the end of her days in her high-rise Manhattan apartment, hallucinates a brilliant fantasy sequence in which she walks into her living room to find Jack Warner (Stanley Tucci), Hedda Hopper (Judy Davis), and Davis. Warner and Hopper—the forces who willed the stars’ great rivalry into existence, for good publicity and better copy—part, and Crawford sits alone with Davis.\n\nIt’s tender, cathartic, and tragic to see these two Hollywood titans put their vulnerability and ego aside to connect. The sad irony of the fantasy, though, is that in the loneliness of these women’s final years, they never realized how much they truly had in common. They were strong women who battled the studio system to build long-lasting careers, only to be tossed aside as talk-show punchlines the moment the industry decided their expiration date was up. They focused so intently on their careers that they never had truly satisfying relationships with family or friends, and would go on to become the subjects of vengeful memoirs from their ungrateful daughters. And they would cope with the despair of their dwindling careers—and in turn, their crumbling identities—in the same way: by becoming alcoholic recluses fixated on the past.\n\nIn the finale, Murphy allows for another fantasy for the duo by showing Davis dialing Crawford’s number after hearing that her What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? co-star is sick. But Davis cannot bring herself to speak into the receiver—one final missed opportunity at what could have been a meaningful friendship. In a real-life interview, though, Davis’s daughter, B.D., explained why she thought her mother never thawed her iciness toward Crawford.\n\n“Mother felt they had nothing in common,” B.D. said, according to Shaun Considine’s The Divine Feud. “And at that time she couldn’t be friends with herself. She was full of self-pity and hatred.”\n\nWithout a lifeline from Davis or anyone else in Hollywood, Crawford’s final years were actually even sadder than they are as depicted on Murphy’s Feud finale.",

        "text": "Dwayne Johnson's Luke Hobbs and Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw were adversaries during Furious 7, and their feud continued into The Fate of the Furious, but as that latter movie chugged along, the two found themselves working together to bring down Charlize Theron's Cipher. Rather than keep their dynamic going in another of the main Fast and the Furious movies, Universal gave the green light to a spinoff movie starring Hobbs and Shaw, which is reportedly being called... well, Hobbs and Shaw, and now it's official: Deadpool 2 director David Leitch will helm that spinoff.\n\nIt was reported back in early February that David Leitch was in early talks to direct Hobbs and Shaw, and today EW confirmed that Leitch has officially signed on to the movie. David Leitch spent years in Hollywood as a stuntman/stunt coordinator, but he kicked off his directing career with 2014's John Wick, which he co-helmed with Chad Stahelski. Leitch followed up with Atomic Blonde and next month's Deadpool 2, making Hobbs and Shaw his fourth movie on his directorial resume. He will be working off a script written by Chris Morgan, who has penned all of the Fast and the Furious movies since 2006's Tokyo Drift.\n\nThe Fast and the Furious franchise has changed quite a bit since it launched in 2001, morphing into movies revolving around street races and heists to its protagonists now often working to save the world. But along with cars, one of the constants in this film series has been action, and with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham being the stars of Hobbs and Shaw, you need to double down on that particular element. Hiring David Leitch as director is a good step towards ensuring that happens, as he has plenty of experience with stunt-driven action both in front of and behind the camera. While it's reasonable to assume that driving/racing will still factor into this spinoff, given that Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw are two of the best fighters among the main Fast and the Furious characters, one would imagine that means there will be even more throwing down of fisticuffs compared to the main series entries.\n\nNo plot details for Hobbs and Shaw have been revealed yet, though as with the previous movies, you can count on the spinoff being packed with craziness. When we last saw these two in The Fate of the Furious, they were celebrating with Dom Toretto and the rest of the crew in having successfully Dom's kid and stopped Cipher's plans. However, Cipher eluded capture, so perhaps the spinoff will see Hobbs and Shaw tracking her down, though I suspect there isn't a shortage of other baddies for them to take on.\n\nHobbs and Shaw will race into theaters on July 26, 2019, and so far has no competition that opening weekend, though that will change eventually. Keep checking back with CinemaBlend for more updates about the Fast and the Furious spinoff and the franchise as a whole, and be sure to look through our 2018 release guide to learn what movies are coming out later this year.",

        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner is opening up about the difficulty of maintaining a relationship with her kids following her gender transition, the mistakes she’s made in her journey and how she once thought the only time she would get to publicly wear woman’s clothing would be in her coffin.\n\nThe 68-year-old reality television star pours her heart out during a new profile for Broadly, in which she discusses her strained family relationships.\n\n“I spend a lot of time by myself here in the house,” she tells transgender journalist Diana Tourjee. “I have a lot of children, but sometimes just because of circumstances, maintaining a close relationship with your kids is very tough. They all have lives. They’ve all moved on.”\n\n“We’re just human beings; we’re going to be here for a very short time,” Caitlyn adds. “We come and we go and at the end, when it’s all said and done, hopefully your family is going to be there.”\n\nCaitlyn also goes into detail about her initial plans to complete a gender transition by the time she turned 40, in 1989, only to get started, then backtrack, after she and then-wife, Kris Jenner, welcomed their daughter, Kendall, in 1995.\n\nAccording to the article, Caitlyn underwent more than four years of hormone therapy and had developed “a little B-cup” by the time she met Kris (who denied knowing that Caitlyn -- who went by Bruce at the time -- was transgender when they met, during an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians).\n\n\"When Kendall was born, I had liposuction and got rid of [my breasts],” explains Caitlyn, who welcomed a second daughter, Kylie, with Kris in 1997, and has four other children from previous relationships. “Because I thought, ‘I can’t even go swimming with my kid.’”\n\nWhile she completed the transformation in 2017, she says there was a time when she imagined Caitlyn might only ever materialize upon the death of Bruce -- sharing how years ago she wanted to state in her will that she wished to be buried in female clothing.\n\n“I thought about that a lot over the years,” she says. “And, it would shock everybody. Screw ‘em.”\n\nAt her lowest point as Bruce, she kept a wig and women’s clothing on board her plane and would allow Caitlyn to come to life while up in the sky, far away from the real world and feeling “free as can be.”\n\nCaitlyn also addresses the controversy ignited by her political views and comments made during media interviews, which have upset the LBGTQ community.\n\n“Along the way, did I make mistakes? Absolutely,” she says. “But I never did it maliciously. I just didn’t know, you know? And I really didn’t realize how critical the community was going to be.”\n\nRegardless of the controversy, she stands by her political standing.\n\n“I think it’s good that I’m on the Republican side because the Republicans know that, and I have an immediate in with them to change their minds,” she says. “The Republicans need the most work when it comes to our issues, I get that. I would rather work from the inside. I’m not the type of person who is going to stand on a street corner with a sign and jump up and down. No, I’m going to go have dinner with these people.”\n\nThe transgender community aren’t the only ones whom she has felt “bashing” her. The Kardashians reportedly felt \"betrayed\" when Caitlyn published her 2017 memoir, The Secrets of My Life.\n\n“I got the trans community out there bashing on me, I got the Kardashians out there bashing on me,” she reflects. “All I do is sit here in the house and try to stay out of trouble.”\n\nSee more on the I Am Cait star below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

        "text": "What’s the story?\n\nNikki Bella turned down the opportunity to appear on the latest season of Dancing With The Stars in favour of focusing on her WWE return. The news was revealed on the most recent episode of E! Network’s Total Divas.\n\nIn case you didn’t know...\n\nDancing With The Stars is an American television show, and the concept is fairly obvious given the name. A string of celebrities swap their regular lives for the dancefloor in an attempt to impress the judges and take home the title at the end of the season. Some fans may be familiar with the show courtesy of Chris Jericho’s stint on it a few years back.\n\nThe heart of the matter\n\nOn the aforementioned episode of Total Divas, Nikki had the following to say to her agent when it came to actually accepting the opportunity.\n\n'I'm ... I'm gonna pass. I know it's an amazing opportunity, but I just ... I really want my comeback to be in that ring and nowhere else.''\n\nGiven when the show was filmed we have yet to see her actual return to the ring which, as we all know, has now taken place.\n\nAlso read: 5 Reasons why Nikki Bella is the greatest female WWE Superstar of all time\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see whether or not they show Nikki getting back inside the squared circle before the end of the season, but in terms of her current trajectory, there’s a chance that The Fearless One could end up on DWTS after all. It seems as if she’s taking even longer off from the ring this time round, so a run on the show wouldn’t be entirely out of the question.\n\nAuthor’s take\n\nIt seems as if Nikki going on DWTS would’ve suited her down to a tee, but we’re glad that she decided to return to the ring instead. She got a series of good pops during her latest run, and no matter what anyone else says, the proposal at WrestleMania was a heart-warming moment for fans of Total Divas and Nikki herself.\n\nSend us news tips at [email protected]",

        "text": "\n\nSome disturbing, but not surprising, news is billowing out from the set of “The Real” like smoke from an extinguished fire.\n\nThe “fire” was the firing of popular co-host Tamar Braxton for basically five major reasons, including: On-set tantrums, “p-ssing off’ sponsors, and a focus group that revealed Tamar’s “aggressive eye-rolling and mouth-smacking” turned off “educated women” viewers as they are “indicative of behavior African-American women have worked years to overcome.”\n\nExecutives of ‘The Real’ reportedly fired Tamar from “The Real” for three real reasons:\n\nNegative feedback on her ‘ghetto’ persona received from focus groups of the daytime talk show\n\nOn-set insubordination\n\nAdvertiser complaints – (The show’s sales team made it clear that advertisers did not want her in their segments due to her antics and lack of cooperation).\n\nOn Saturday, May 21, Braxton and her co-hosts (Adrienne Bailon, Jeannie Mai, Loni Love and Tamara Mowry) all got phone calls from the show’s parent company Telepictures/Warner Bros. to inform the group that the popular talk show would be moving forward without Braxton.\n\nBraxton was blindsided by the news, as were all of her co-hosts.\n\n“Everyone was caught off guard. None of them saw it coming and everyone was completely blindsided by the decision,” a source close to production tells Daily Mail Online.\n\nThe cast was also taken aback because, as Loni Love stated in her video response, all five cast members had just completed a new photo shoot for images that were supposed to be used to promote their upcoming third season.\n\nThe group was also scheduled to fly to New Orleans together over the July 4th weekend for a rare off-season multi-day taping to occur at this year’s Essence Festival, where they were scheduled to film episodes of their show and premiere them when they returned in September.\n\nBut an alleged flagrant Braxton error in judgement derailed that those plans. The show’s executive producer is said to have cursed her out in earshot of other staffers on set a few weeks ago, after Braxton reportedly sulked over losing a game during the taping, the Daily Mail reports.\n\n“It was an ugly scene. Pinterest was sponsoring the segment and Tamar was genuinely upset she was losing the game.\n\n‘She really acted out during the taping in front of the studio audience and then exploded behind the scenes once the show was done.\n\nProducers had to heavily edit the segment to make it presentable to air on TV, but the sponsor was on set for the segment and witnessed it all,” the source explains. (you can read it in its entirety here).\n\nAccording to production staff, the newspaper continues, Braxton’s outbursts on set were frequent and she regularly blew up at the executive producer and oftentimes her husband, prolific producer Vincent Hubert and/or her co-hosts would have to work to put out the flames.\n\n“Let’s just say she was becoming unbearable to work with,” the source said.\n\nBut the move to finally ax Braxton probably came when she took time off of “The Real” to contend on “Dancing with the Stars” that producers realized the show could survive without her.\n\nFirst off, there was peace on set and, most importantly, the ratings maintained and at times, went up depending on whom was guest co-hosting the show, the source explained.\n\nAfter Telepictures received a two-year renewal of ‘The Real’ on all Fox stations and on BET where it re-airs, execs reportedly wanted to see what they could do to make the show better for Seasons 3 and 4.\n\nHere came the focus groups.\n\nThe research from the focus group was also a major factor in the decision to fire Braxton. She did doesn’t score well with educated women, The Daily Mail reports:\n\n‘The focus group research showed that most educated and working women did not identify with Tamar’s show vernacular and her use of words known to be popular among drag queens and some gay men – phrases like “get your life,” “where they do that at,” “have several seats.”\n\n‘It was even said she seemed more suited to be a judge on RuPaul’s Drag Race on Logo instead of a talk show host on The Real,’ revealed the source.\n\n‘The research went on to say that most educated and working women found her to be ‘ghetto’ and that her aggressive eye-rolling, neck-rolling and the smacking of her mouth were indicative of ‘stereotypical behavior that African American women have worked years to overcome,” the source continued.\n\nThe Real’s executive producer used the aforementioned reasons (the focus group findings, on-set insubordination and the sales team issues about advertisers not wanting Braxton in their segments) to convince Warner Bros. to give Braxton the boot!\n\nVince Herbert, Braxton’s husband and manager, was kept in the dark about these decision to get rid of his wife.\n\n“He knew they were having problems with her and he shielded Tamar from a lot of what was being said and done, but in the end his producer credit on the show was more about vanity and less about control,” the source revealed.\n\nFor the record, Warner Bros. wanted to work out an exit agreement with Braxton that wouldn’t make viewers aware she was being fired but before they could hammer out a joint statement and an agreement that was good for both parties, Tamar had already posted that cryptic message on IG about betrayal and an unnamed person who she feels ‘stabbed’ her ‘in the back.’\n\n‘It’s that type of impulsive behavior and lack of self control that is why she is off the show,’ the source said.\n\nAbout Post Author",

        "text": "Chris Soules has entered a conditional guilty plea regarding the 2017 car crash that left one person dead.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by PEOPLE on Tuesday, the Bachelor alum, 37, has “entered a plea of guilty to the crime of: Leaving the Scene of an Accident Resulting in Serious Injury, an aggravated misdemeanor.”\n\nIn the documents, the State of Iowa moved to amend the trial information — to charge Soules with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in serious injury — and the Bachelor alum “filed a written guilty plea to the amended charge, conditioned his plea of guilty upon the court’s acceptance of the terms of the parties’ plea agreement.”\n\nBut, “if the court rejects the plea agreement, the defendant will be afforded the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea,” the documents state.\n\nAccording to his written conditional guilty plea submitted to the Iowa District Court on Tuesday and obtained by PEOPLE, the aggravated misdemeanor charge “carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment of not more than two (2) years and/or by a fine of not more than six thousand two hundred and fifty dollars ($6,250.00) and a minimum penalty of a fine of six hundred twenty-five dollars ($625.00) along with a suspended jail sentence or a deferred judgment.”\n\nHe later states that in exchange for his guilty plea, the court “will order a confidential presentence investigation report (PSI) be completed in advance of sentencing and this document will be provided to the State and to me. I also understand that the instant plea to the aggravated misdemeanor will resolve any and all criminal matters, investigations, etc. arising from the accident on April 24, 2017 and no further prosecution or charges will be brought against me. … I understand the court may accept or reject the agreement or defer its decision as to acceptance or rejection until receipt of a PSI.”\n\nHis sentencing is set for Jan. 8 at 1:30 p.m.\n\nOn April 25, 2017, Soules was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of a car accident that resulted in the death of 66-year-old Vietnam veteran Kenneth E. Mosher.\n\nGeilenfeld Funeral Home\n\nHe was arrested in Iowa after he allegedly crashed his truck into a tractor, running it off the road into a ditch. His vehicle was later found at a home that he was present at, and Soules allegedly refused to leave until officers obtained a search warrant several hours later.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Andi Dorfman on Former ‘Bachelor’ Star Chris Soules After Deadly Car Crash: ‘He’s Hanging in There’\n\nIn his written conditional guilty plea, Soules detailed the crash and admitted his wrongdoing to not providing his vehicle’s registration number to police.\n\n“By way of factual basis, I hereby state that on or about April 24, 2017 in Buchanan County, Iowa, I was driving a vehicle that was involved in an accident resulting in serious injury to another person. I knew the accident occurred and knew it resulted in an injury to another person,” wrote Soules. “Though I immediately stopped, called 911 and identified myself, and rendered reasonable aid to the injured person — including requesting an ambulance and administering CPR while the ambulance was en route — I acknowledge I did not provide the registration number of the vehicle I was driving to 911 dispatch or law enforcement as required by Iowa Code 321.263.”\n\nIowa State Patrol alleged that he fled the scene, violating the Iowa code that states: “If the accident causes the death of a person, all surviving drivers shall remain at the scene of the accident except to seek necessary aid or to report the accident to law enforcement authorities.”\n\nAfter entering a not guilty plea in May 2017 to the charge, Soules’ legal team filed a motion to dismiss the “failure to remain” charge on constitutional grounds, refuting the last sentence of the Iowa state code.\n\nThe attorneys said in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that “because Mr. Soules indisputably stopped his vehicle, returned to the injured driver, contacted law enforcement, provided aid to the injured driver, arranged for medical treatment for the injured driver, remained until emergency personnel responded to the injured party, and provided identification data, the State’s charge must be dismissed.”\n\nTheir request to dismiss was denied in January before being brought to the Iowa Supreme Court. In February, multiple outlets reported that an Iowa Supreme Court denied an appeal.",

DeGeneres even explains that the coming-out episode was titled “The Puppy Episode” because “’Ellen Throws Her Career Away’ seemed a little too on the nose.” Actually, that’s not the real reason for the “Puppy Episode” name, but you can see Ellen’s explanation for it below. In an interview with Oprah after the coming out aired, the comedian said she did so “because it’s okay.

Danielsen was arrested for the incident after she allegedly choked and hit her then 18-year-old daughter, TMZ reported at the time. She was later charged with assault in an Iowa court.\n\nAbraham walked off the set of the WE tv reality series on Friday night after her mom called the since-dropped charges “bogus” and claimed that Abraham had threatened to kill her.\n\nRelated: Teen Mom Stars, Then and Now!

I can’t stand it.”\n\nAbraham hinted that future episodes of Marriage Boot Camp will also focus on her fight with Danielsen. “There is an episode where we talk about traumatic experiences, my mom and I, and we still cannot get on the same page,” she said. “So, sometimes between lie detector tests and traumatic experiences, there’s just a certain point in time where you’re like, ‘Somebody does not have the wherewithal to take accountability to even remember things,’ and you’re like, ‘Why do I even want to be around them anymore?’ The best narcissists can block things out and act like nothing ever happened to just keep going.”\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars.

Over the past year, their on-screen chemistry has always been on point during the daily talk show — and that’s because their relationship is strong both on and off the air.\n\n“They get along famously,” a source told E! News of the pair. “Ryan and Kelly have the same work ethic and values. That’s why it works so well.” A source also told Closer Weekly exclusively, that “they are very in sync with each other.” The insider added, “With Ryan, Kelly feels like she’s met her match. She says this has been the best few months she’s had on the show since she joined 16 years ago.”\n\nHowever, there’s been some struggle with their relationship behind the scenes recently following Ryan’s sexual harassment allegations. According to Page Six, Kelly is worried about how Ryan’s situation could impact their show. “Kelly doesn’t want to risk anything happening to Live. She is understandably livid because it could potentially f - - k up her show,” a source told the news outlet in March.\n\nAnother insider added, “They oversell their friendship. Her reputation is rolled up in this — this is her show. For Kelly, there’s not a Plan B. She has to make a decision and rally around him.”\n\nNeither Kelly nor Ryan’s reps have spoken out, but one source noted that their friendship has made this whole thing very difficult. “He’s one of her closest friends, and they’re very protective of each other. They’ve known each other for years and talk about everything. It’s been a tough week,” the insider said.\n\nBut don’t worry, they won’t let this get in the way of their talk show. “Working day-to-day has been a learning and growing experience for both of them,” a source told Closer. Another insider told E! News, “Kelly and Ryan have open and transparent conversations. There will be no surprises. They are partners.” Phew!",

And I am speaking on behalf of all us here,” she said. “I know what an easy, professional, great person you are and I feel very, very lucky to work with you each and every day.

        "text": "Cara Kelly\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK — Rei Kawakubo skittered up the stairs of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Monday night, only faintly glancing at the photographers and reporters chanting her name from the sides of the red, or rather, blue carpet. A stranger to the scene would have hardly known she was an important guest at the A-list circus that is the annual Costume Institute Gala, let alone the star of the whole show.\n\nThe reclusive designer, who founded label Comme des Garçons in 1969, is the focus of the museum’s latest exhibit and a rare bird in an industry full of peacocks. She scarcely gives interviews, doesn’t have personal social media accounts and won’t measure her success on praise from others.\n\nHer designs speak for themselves. And in that way, her ethos was the unifier of a disparate and relatively quiet blue carpet.\n\nGuests to the yearly fundraiser held in honor of the exhibit are encouraged to channel the subject of the new showcase, which typically happens with varying degrees of success. The attendees who best hit Monday's theme — channeling Kawakubo through her own creations or by working with another designer in attendance — made their way up the steps of the Met without much fuss. Helen Lasichanh, the wife of co-host Pharrell Williams, hit the carpet early in a look from one of Kawakubo’s most recent collections which experimented with silhouettes and bound the body without armholes. Like Kawakubo, she barely spoke to waiting reporters, because when wearing an outfit like that, what’s left to say?\n\nPharrell, also in pieces from the designer, focused on his love of the brand when speaking with reporters.\n\n\"What I feel is lucky and blessed to be able to do it, because its one of my heros,\" he said of co-hosting the night. \"Rei Kawakubo is the best of the best. Comme des Garçons is one of my favorite brands.\"\n\nRihanna climbed towards the Met entrance in another bulbous Comme des Garçons creation, and like Lasichanh, let what she was wearing do the communicating. Fans screamed but the Barbadian singer and fashionista kept mostly silent behind the blossoming, 3-D petals.\n\nBlack-ish’s Tracee Ellis Ross demurely acknowledged her cocoon-dress was also made by Comme des Garçons before striding inside, no time for interviews, her wrangler told waiting reporters.\n\nKaty Perry solemnly processed in a straight line to the museum's door, dragging her lengthy red Maison Margiela train and veil behind her.\n\nOthers likewise had success channeling the avant-garde dress code without wearing the band tee-shirt to the concert. Priyanka Chopra and Ralph Lauren had a clever play on Kawakubo's legacy.\n\n\"Everything that comes out of her is so androgynous and has no lines as far as gender, and this was sort of that,\" Chopra said. \"A trench gown.\"\n\nOthers were at least drawn out of their comfort zones. Claire Foy in Erdem, Candice Swanepoel in Topshop and Kate Bosworth in Tory Burch were among the many guests to say their ensembles for the evening were the most over-the-top they'd ever worn.\n\nBut if their choices spoke for themselves, so too did the starlets whose clothes alluded to the fact that they missed the entire concept.\n\n“I work around the figure, but I am never limited by what the figure has to be,” Kawakubo says in the guide to her exhibition.\n\nSo what would she think of the now-exhausted naked dress trend that showed up again on the likes of Kendall Jenner? One can only imagine she’d find the unfaltering obsession with figure-baring outfits to be limiting. Lingerie brand La Perla was behind the thin slip of a garment and black thong — in what could be called a poorly planned marketing splash, though the reality TV star’s Instagram followers likely ate it up.\n\nAnd therein lies a central reason to what makes Kawakubo's exhibit so refreshing. In the age of President Trump and constant self-promotion and validation on social media, a strong voice that's focused on what's new and never seen before is a mythical thing.",

        "text": "Though The 100‘s Octavia will probably always remain a fan favorite, Marie Avgeropoulos knows that her character’s latest turn has stirred up “a lot of backlash” from viewers this season.\n\n“I was given a heads-up from [showrunner] Jason Rothenberg that this was going to be a challenging season for me as an actress, and he was definitely right about that,” Avgeropoulos tells TVLine. “But it’s also been very rewarding. Octavia always changing. She’s not a hero, she’s not a villain — she’s a wild card.”\n\nAvgeropoulos says it’s important to remember that Octavia’s evolution into the Red Queen “wasn’t instantaneous. It was a slow burn that took place over six challenging, painful years.”\n\n“Towards the end of the season, there’s one of my favorites episodes called ‘The Dark Years’ which gives Octavia some emotional redemption,” she teases. “I’m excited for fans to see what happened in those six years during the time jump. They’ll find out more of who Bloodraina really is and how she became that way. It wasn’t easy for her. She lost her innocence and a part of herself.”\n\nHere’s hoping that redemption arc also helps the Blake siblings find peace. Avgeropoulos correctly notes that “Octavia and Bellamy have become incredibly different people. It also doesn’t help that Octavia is starting to see him as an obstacle in her overall game plan — a potential enemy of Wonkru.”\n\nSpeaking of Octavia’s enemies, we can also look forward to her impending confrontation with Echo when the two formally reunite tonight (The CW, 9/8c). “I’m pretty sure Echo — the woman who stabbed her and pushed her off a cliff — is the last person on Earth that Octavia would want to have as a sister-in-law,” she says.\n\nYour thoughts on Octavia’s new persona?

        "text": "In the seven months since his abrupt separation from wife Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt has kept a low profile. It all changed this week when his first interview post the split appeared in GQ. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie separated in September 2016.\n\nPitt had been accused of beating his 15-year-old son Maddox on a plane in September, which prompted Jolie to file for divorce. The FBI and Child Services investigated him for child abuse. He was romantically linked to his Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, which she immediately denied.\n\nStay tuned with breaking news on HT Channel on Facebook. Join Now\n\nThe GQ spread, apart from the interview, includes a massive 8-day photoshoot of Pitt, 53, “tumbling through” three national parks, and a music video.\n\nBut according to the BBC, it was all a planned move by Pitt to correct his faltering image. In the interview, the actor admitted to having an alcohol problem, and how it might have caused the problems in his life. He said he is undergoing therapy and is on a road to recovery after coming to terms with the “self-inflicted” situation he’s in.\n\nBut instead of being called out for his behaviour, which, by his own admission is the reason his family was jarringly “ripped apart” the Internet has sided with him.\n\nAn article titled “Why Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword” published on E! said, “Throwing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of goodwill built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what he’s gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what he’s doing to right the ship.”\n\nVanity Fair said, “Pitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook. Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way. He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that he’s doing a lot of work on himself.”\n\nAnd Huffington Post completes the trifecta of acceptance: “People like (Brad) do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery.”\n\nThe BBC quotes PR guru Mark Borkowski as saying that Pitt would have “Total copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval,” on the interview.\n\n“But of course the timing is calculated,” Borkowski continues. “The language is calculated. Everything is calculated. And everything is a gamble.”\n\n“A lot of people prefer to stay before the waterline and not do it. He’s taken a massive risk and I can think of many who just wouldn’t go this far.”\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more",

Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski aren't just \"Morning Joe\" co-hosts anymore — they're also husband and wife.\n\nA spokesperson for the duo confirmed the happy news to TODAY.\n\nThe small event took place in Washington, at an especially fitting location for the former congressman and Brzezinski — the National Archives, with the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence serving as a backdrop to the ceremony.\n\nThe pair's \"Morning Joe\" pal — and our very own Sunday TODAY anchor — Willie Geist wasn't able to attend (due to some \"very early morning television\" the next day), but he spoke about the wedding on the show Monday.\n\n\"Joe and Mika are off today and this week. Why, you ask? They had a very busy weekend,\" he stated early in the broadcast, before sharing a few details with viewers. \"Joe and Mika were surrounded by all of their children, which made it very special for them.\"\n\nIn addition to Scarborough's four kids and her two, all from previous marriages, family from both sides and a small group of close friends gathered together to witness their union.\n\nThe couple exchanged vows at the National Archives. Miller Hawkins\n\n\"We wanted it to be really small and simple and not what you expected from Mika and Joe,\" the bride, who wore a white midi-length dress covered in a sheer polka-dot lace, told Vanity Fair Saturday. \"Everything we do is exposed, and everything felt exposed every step of the way, so we want this to be private until it’s over. We wanted to recognize it more quietly and have the people who are most important to us around us.\"\n\nKeeping the guest list short was just one way they assured the event would remain a secret ahead of time. They shared with the publication that the invitations were extended via phone calls rather than hard copies, the reservations were made under the name of a friend and the Thanksgiving weekend date was selected for the rare hubbub-free time it brings to Washington.\n\nScarborough added, \"We made the decision a year ago to dramatically change our lives and have a low-key existence. The more time we can spend with our family, the happier we are.\"\n\nAnd they were clearly happy on Saturday — as were those in attendance.\n\nScarborough's former House colleague, Rep. Elijah Cummings, officiated the wedding, and he later tweeted that \"it was a pleasure\" to do so.\n\nCongratulations to Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough! It was a pleasure to officiate your beautiful wedding. I wish you years of love and happiness together! — Elijah E. Cummings (@RepCummings) November 25, 2018\n\nShortly after the nuptials, rather than sharing a wedding pic, Brzezinski took to Instagram with a photo of her holding a small amphibian and puckering up.\n\nIn the caption, she simply wrote, \"I kissed the frog.\"\n\nThis marriage marks the third for Scarborough, 55, and second for Brzezinski, 51. They've worked side-by-side on \"Morning Joe\" for more than 11 years and announced their engagement last spring.",

        "text": "Photo: Netflix\n\nYes, there are spoilers below about Stranger Things and Stranger Things 2. If you haven’t watched yet and want to remain spoiler-free, please keep that in mind.\n\nStranger Things was an instant sensation when it debuted on Netflix last year. Its potent blend of frights, ’80s nostalgia, and the revival of Winona Ryder’s career made it a hit with fans and critics alike. But there was one thing that Stranger Things fans loved above all else: Barb.\n\nIn season one, Barbara Holland was Nancy Wheeler’s best friend, the nerdy high-schooler clad in Sally Jesse Raphael’s glasses and a puffy, ridiculously cerulean parka. Barb was quiet but loyal, awkward but fabulous, forgotten by Hawkins, Indiana but remembered by the entire audience. She was so great, in fact, actress Shannon Purser nabbed an Emmy nomination for the part. Sadly, Barb was also one of the demogorgon’s first victims. While everyone raced ahead to rescue Will Byers from the Upside Down, Stranger Things treated Barb’s death with the sort of shrug normally reserved for dropping a coin down a storm drain or losing a half-broken umbrella. She was last seen in the Upside Down, with a gross slug monster crawling out of her corpse, and that appeared to be that.\n\nNow, with Stranger Things 2 set to dominate TV marathons this weekend and beyond, one question looms large: Will we finally get justice for Barb?\n\nThe second season opens with Nancy (Natalia Dyer) furious that no one really knows what happened to her friend. The trench coats at the Department of Energy stashed Barb’s car at a bus station, so everyone in Hawkins thinks that she skipped town because teens kept mocking her proto-normcore fashion sense. “It’s like everyone forgot, and no one cares,” Nancy tells her boyfriend, Steve (Joe Keery). “Except her parents … and it’s destroying them.”\n\nCut to the Holland residence, where Nancy and Steve suffer through an excruciatingly sad dinner of KFC with Barb’s parents as penance for knowing what really happened but not being able to tell them. Mr. and Mrs. Holland believe their daughter is still out there, and they’re selling their house to pay a shady investigative journalist to track her down. Understandably, Nancy reacts to this news by getting wasted at a house party and slurring to Steve, “You’re pretending like everything’s okay. Like we didn’t kill Barb. Like we’re partying. We’re partying.”\n\nThe funny thing about Stranger Things 2 is that it basically mimics the format of Stranger Things original recipe. Will (Noah Schnapp) is in danger again. Both seasons feature a new girl wreaking havoc with the group dynamic of Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin). Will’s mother Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) once again goes from a well-coiffed cashier to someone with the hair of a Times Square Elmo. And just like last time, Nancy has to leave Steve and join up with Will’s brother Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) in order to find Barb.\n\nSoon enough, Nancy learns that the “journalist” is a conspiracy-theory nut named Murray Bauman (Brett Gelman), who believes that Barb tried to help the “Russian girl” who was seen around town — a.k.a. Eleven. His working theory is that Barb was killed because she knew too much. So, in a pretty ingenuous move, Nancy and Jonathan get themselves captured by the feds and taken to Hawkins Lab, where they meet Dr. Owens (Paul Reisder) and record him admitting what really happened to Barb. Then they take the tape to Murray in hopes of exposing the truth to the wider public.\n\nWhen they arrive at Murray’s bunker, he has a wall dedicated to his Barb investigation and all of his “evidence” is connected with red strings. (He’s basically like Carrie Mathison when she goes off her medicine, but I looked at that wall and thought, “Same,” because that is what my apartment looked like in the middle of my Barb fever too.) Nancy tells Murray that he has everything wrong about Barb and fills him in on the truth about the Upside Down. After he hears the tape of Dr. Owens, they come up with a plan to water down the story so that the press will actually report it. Then, for several episodes, Stranger Things yet again forgets about Barb while Nancy and Jonathan hook up, Eleven goes to Chicago to turn herself into Jessica Alba from Dark Angel, Steve reveals the secret to his pompadour come mullet, and everyone fights a bunch of devil dogs (a much better name than “demodogs,” in my humble opinion).\n\nWith all of those non-Barb objectives complete, our heroine finally gets a funeral after the Department of Energy admits culpability in her death, claiming that she was poisoned and they conspired to cover it up. Presumably, Barb’s parents got a nice settlement and Murray got paid, which is kind of ridiculous because Nancy and Jonathan did all the hard work. (All he did was lie around his nasty apartment, listening to jazz and drinking watered-down Stoli. Shouldn’t the teens get a cut too?)\n\nIn the end, Barb is still dead and now everyone knows it, but they think that she was a mere victim of government malfeasance rather than the prey of an interdimensional alien that stalked her after her Nancy bailed to have sex with Steve. She gets some photos placed at the center of some nice bouquets during her funeral, but that’s about it. She’ll probably be forgotten again by the time Stranger Things 3 comes around.\n\nClearly, this is not what true justice looks like. Justice for Barb would be if someone actually appreciated her. If someone saw Barb for who she was and said, “She was great and she deserved better.” Nancy is grappling with a lot of difficult emotions in Stranger Things 2, and she does the admirable thing by helping the Hollands find closure, but she’s mostly just driven by a need to assuage her own guilt. That’s not justice as much as it is penance.\n\nGet all your Stranger Things 2 questions answered at the show’s Vulture Festival LA panel on November 18! Tickets available here.",

        "text": "ABC has renewed “Modern Family” for two more seasons of 22 episodes each, TheWrap has learned.\n\nThe hit family comedy has officially been renewed through Season 10, which will air in the 2018-19 season. The order will bring the series to a staggering total of 232 episodes.\n\nThe news comes after months of negotiations between the network, producers 20th Century Fox Television and the cast, whose previous deals expired at the end of Season 8, though a renewal was likely always in the cards given the show’s success in the ratings.\n\n“Modern Family has been the centerpiece of our comedy brand for eight seasons and we are thrilled to have it on our schedule for two more years. Steve and Chris have created such endearing characters, and the cast is second-to-none,” said ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey in a statement.\n\n“We are beyond thrilled that we get to spend more time with these characters, these amazing actors, our ridiculously-talented writers and our incredible crew – all of whom are like family to us. And the good kind of family, not the kind that argues with you all the time,” added co-creator and executive producer Steve Levitan.\n\n“Modern Family” joins the Shondaland dramas “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal” and “How to Get Away With Murder” and the long-running comedy “The Middle” as the five ABC shows already renewed. The Kerry Washington-led “Scandal” is reportedly set to end after the conclusion of its seventh season next year.\n\nThe news comes as the broadcast networks begin to finalize their fall programming slates ahead of the upfront presentations next week. ABC also recently announced that it will revive the Fox reality singing competition series “American Idol” next season.",

        "text": "Time for your regular reminder that over the next four days, I’ll be giving my quick reactions to the trailers presented to advertisers in New York City. These aren’t formal reviews. How could they be? I haven’t seen the darned shows. They’re just gut responses to sales pitches. If advertisers can pony up billions based on these clips, I can tell you if they’re good or bad. My annual Take Me to the Pilots series will begin in a month and then real reviews will start in September. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nOne day after CBS took advertisers back to the ‘80s with shiny new versions of Murphy Brown and Magnum P.I., The CW closed out broadcast TV’s upfronts week with another healthy dose of nostalgia.\n\nExpanding to six nights of original programming in the fall, the network presented a schedule with five new shows premiering between fall and midseason, two of which — Charmed and Roswell, New Mexico — will induce young adult soap opera flashbacks. Another of the shows, Legacies, didn’t have any footage to show yet, but as a spinoff of The Originals (itself a spinoff of The Vampire Diaries), it also brings a measure of familiarity.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s get to The CW’s trailer rankings.\n\n4) In the Dark | I don’t pay as much attention to development as I used to, so I hadn’t heard a word about In the Dark. I have to admit that my first instinct after seeing the ridiculous poster for this dramedy was to think it was a parody show. A parody of what? For what? I have no idea. I didn’t get that far. And my first instinct after watching the first half of the trailer was to think that this had to be some sort of hastily made filler programming for CW Seed. It was only when I saw John From Cincinnati himself (Austin Nichols, who is no longer on the show) in the trailer that I began to realize that this story of a sex-addicted blind misanthrope attempting to solve a murder with the help of her nosey support dog Pretzel was a real series that will air on real television. I’m still not completely convinced. The trailer was tonally muddled, extremely cheap-looking and made me giggle in several totally inappropriate places. Pretzel looks like a very good dog, though. Good dog, Pretzel!\n\n3) Charmed | I was not a Charmed viewer. I must have watched two full episodes ever. The only time I’m aware of the show is when I watch basketball at night on TNT and there’s a repeat of Charmed on the next morning. I’ll probably watch more episodes of this remake, which pushed its female empowerment message hard in its first trailer. Jennie Snyder Urman’s Jane the Virgin track record has definitely bought this one a few extra hours from me, though I wish more of Urman’s sense of humor was pushed to the forefront, because that’s what I’ll be watching and hoping for. I think stars Melonie Diaz, Sarah Jeffery and Madeleine Mantock all seem OK, though the magical effects look mighty middling.\n\n2) Roswell, New Mexico | Wasn’t this one supposed to come with some sort of immigration subtext? I was looking forward to that. The trailer eschewed that angle, if it still exists, in favor of sudsy supernatural romance. As it should. It’s a sales pitch and not one aimed at me. I’m a Jeanine Mason fan dating back to her run on So You Think You Can Dance and her small part on Bunheads, so I’m definitely the target demo for her debut as a TV lead (assuming you forget the ABC sword-and-sandals epic she did a couple years back and her brief stint on Grey’s Anatomy this season). As with Charmed, I’d love to have seen a shade more humor in a trailer that is very, very, very earnest. Other than a little Southwestern ambiance, this trailer looked interchangeable with The CW’s very short-lived Star-Crossed from a couple years ago, and I refuse to exist that all alien-human love stories are identical!\n\n1) All American | This is one of the best-cut trailers I’ve seen all upfronts week, perhaps the best. I’m pumped enough for this show that I’m going to get over my punctuation anxiety that makes me desperately want to add a hyphen. Unlike In the Dark — still not convinced it’s a real show — I’d heard about this one, but I hadn’t fully realized how completely it’s The O.C. only with football. Watch the trailer again. It’s so nearly a beat-for-beat remake that Josh Schwartz should be getting a tiny slice of residuals, right down to the rich kids’ bacchanal party and somebody sneering “Welcome to…” (in this case “Beverly Hills”) to our main character. Plus, Taye Diggs as Peter Gallagher! Yes, the mustache-twirling racism of the adversarial white characters looks over-the-top, but I appreciated the one joke undercutting gang stereotyping. This looks fun, emotional, corny and inspirational in equal measures and I am there for it! Or at least now I’m excited to watch a full pilot.\n\nCheck back in around a month for the start of my annual Take Me To The Pilots series.",

        "text": "Tituss Burgess delivered one of ET's Standout Performances of the 2017-18 season.\n\nFor four seasons (and a possible movie), Tituss Burgess has embodied Titus Andromedon, the unapologetically loud and proud roommate to Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) on Netflix’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He’s flamboyant. He’s verbose. He’s nothing short of snarky. He’s a struggling actor -- rather, an “undercover superstar” -- who has a tendency to get in the way of his own success. He emotes through Beyonce, hiding nothing from his friend Kimmy, landlord Lillian (Carol Kane), agent Jacqueline White (Jane Krakowski) or ex-lover Mikey (Mike Carlsen).\n\n“Playing him is exhausting,” Burgess tells ET by phone. It’s the day of the Royal Wedding, but the actor is as far removed from the day’s festivities -- he’s traveling to Washington, D.C., where he’s set to perform at the 2018 WNO Opera Gala Concert the next day -- as he is from his onscreen persona. “I don't live in that space. My energy hovers around a two or three on a scale of one to 10.” That’s not to say the actor hasn’t enjoyed playing the character -- in fact, it’s been a career-making moment -- but when it’s 5 a.m. on set and he has to deliver all of Titus’ eccentricities, “it takes a toll.”\n\nBurgess recalls being on set the day before with Kemper as the two filmed scenes from the show’s final episodes when it dawned on both of them that this journey was coming to an end. “She and I looked at each other and realized how blessed we were and what an unusual experience we got to have and what an unusual show we got to do,” he says of the series that has been anything but typical.\n\nTelling the story of a young woman who moves to New York City after being forced to live in an underground bunker for the past 15 years, the incredibly quirky series co-created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock was slated for a 13-episode run on NBC before unexpectedly being sold to Netflix, which picked it up for an initial two seasons. Kimmy Schmidt became the streaming network’s first original half-hour comedy and was met with critical acclaim, as well as 16 Primetime Emmy nominations in its first three seasons. Now, the show is drawing to a close with a final fourth season that's broken up into two parts -- the second half of season four premieres Jan. 25, 2019 -- and a reported movie. (While Burgess confirms that a movie has been proposed, Netflix has yet to make an official announcement or respond to requests for comment about it.)\n\n“I think Kimmy began to sync up with Ellie and both of them began to have the same experience of gratitude, zooming out and being able to see the larger picture. I think the same happened with Titus and myself,” Burgess recalls. (The plot of the final episodes, he teases, mirrors both the real-life and onscreen journeys for Kemper and Burgess.)\n\nThe gratitude also extends not only to the Emmys, which has nominated Burgess for three consecutive Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series awards, but to the streaming platform, which has introduced the actor (and character) to an international audience. “Nothing will match this experience because it put me on the map,” he says.\n\nTituss Burgess in a scene from 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.' - Netflix\n\nAs to why Titus has continuously resonated with voters and viewers alike, he says it’s because of how unique the character is. “I didn’t have that type of representation when I was growing up,” Burgess says. “By the sheer fact that he was new made for something to latch onto. It represented how the landscape in television was and is changing.” There’s also a vicarious experience audiences get by watching someone who is as unfiltered as Titus is, the actor muses, adding that if the show debuted today, he might not have had the same impact. “Titus wouldn’t pop as much under this current administration. People would see it as one of the many unfiltered, loud voices we hear today. Four years ago, believe it or not, was a far more civilized time. Titus up against that backdrop had more of an impression on people.”\n\nWith the show wrapping production, Burgess is now in a unique position in his career where he says he’ll literally be able to create opportunities for himself -- “what it will look like and what I want it to be.” He’s not as worried about what comes next or distancing himself from Titus as he is about tapping into new personalities. “There are many people and many spirits I know and I’m able to download, and the world only saw one of those,” Burgess says. “I’m excited to display other parts of my schizophrenia.”\n\nHe’s working on a new album. He has several upcoming film roles, including one as a creepy elevator operator in Netflix’s Set It Up. The others, he says, haven’t been announced, but he “was shocked” when he got one of them. There’s the musical adaptation of The Preacher’s Wife, which he hopes to bring to Broadway, and which held a reading in December featuring Loretta Devine. “That is shaping up very nicely,” he says.\n\n“I will miss it dearly,” Burgess says of playing Titus, acknowledging that “it's going to feel strange not waking up and putting on those clothes, but my whole world will be just as colorful as the one I just played.”\n\nMORE STANDOUT PERFORMANCES OF THE SEASON:",

        "text": "The CW has renewed “The Originals” and “iZombie” for the 2017-2018 television season, Variety has learned.\n\n“The Originals” will head into its fifth season, while “iZombie” will be heading into its fourth season.\n\nCreated by Julie Plec, “The Originals” is a spinoff of “The Vampire Diaries,” which premiered in 2013. The flagship “Vampire” series signed off this spring, ending its eight season run, so renewing “Originals” keeps the franchise at the network for at least another season.\n\n“Originals” follows Joseph Morgan’s Klaus Mikaelson and his family in New Orleans. Morgan stars alongside Daniel Gillies, Phoebe Tonkin, Charles Michael Davis, Yusuf Gatewood and Riley Voelkel. Plec serves as executive producer with Leslie Morgenstein. The series hails from Bonanza Productions Inc., My So-Called Company, Alloy Entertainment, Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios.\n\nThe show has remained relatively stable in its fourth season, which is currently averaging a 0.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 972,000 viewers per episode. That represents a decrease of just 11% in the key demo and a slight increase in total viewers compared to Season 3.\n\n“iZombie” is based on the characters from DC Entertainment’s Vertigo imprint. Rose McIver toplines the series, and stars alongside Malcolm Goodwin, Rahul Kohli, Robert Buckley, David Anders and Aly Michalka. The show hails from “Veronica Mars” creator Rob Thomas, who executive produces with Diane Ruggiero-Wright, Danielle Stokdyk and Dan Etheridge. Bonanza Productions Inc., Spondoolie Productions and Warner Bros. Television produce the series.\n\nNow in its third season, this supernatural procedural has dipped quite a bit in ratings. Midway through Season 3, it is averaging a 0.3 rating and 905,000 viewers per episode, down over 30% in both measures from Season 2.\n\nWith both renewals, the CW has officially made decisions for every returning show for the 2017-2018 season. “Originals” and “iZombie” join already-renewed series “Arrow,” “D.C.’s Legends of Tomorrow,” “The Flash,” “Supergirl,” “Jane the Virgin,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and “Supernatural.” The network cancelled freshman series “No Tomorrow” and “Frequency.”",

        "text": "“Law & Order: SVU” has been renewed for Season 19 at NBC, Variety has learned.\n\nIn addition, series showrunner Rick Eid will leave the show to assume showrunning duties on fellow Wolf Films series “Chicago PD.” Eid joined “SVU” as a writer and producer at the beginning of Season 18. He had previously worked on “Law & Order” and “Law & Order: Trial by Jury.” No new showrunner for “SVU” has been named.\n\nThe last remaining installment of Dick Wolf’s storied franchise follows life inside the NYPD’s Special Victims Unit, an elite squad that investigates sexually-based offenses, which are considered especially heinous. The series has undergone numerous casting changes over its long run, but series mainstays include Mariska Hargitay and Ice T, the former having been with the show from the very beginning. Newer cast members include Kelli Giddish, Peter Scanavino, and Raúl Esparza.\n\nThe series remains a ratings powerhouse for NBC, ranking among its top scripted programs just under “This Is Us,” “Chicago Fire,” and “Chicago PD.” Season 18 averaged a 1.4 rating in adults 18-49 and 5.8 million viewers per episode.\n\nIt has been nominated for 25 Emmys throughout its run, winning six, including Hargitay’s win in 2006 for outstanding lead actress in a drama series. The series is a Wolf Films production in association with Universal Television. Wolf is the creator and executive producer. Julie Martin, Jonathan Starch, Arthur Forney, Peter Jankowski, and Hargitay are also executive producers.\n\n“SVU” joins previously renewed NBC shows “This Is Us,” “Chicago Fire,” “Chicago Med,” “Chicago PD,” “Superstore,” “The Good Place,” “Taken,” “Shades of Blue,” and “Blindspot.” The network has canceled “Timeless,” “Emerald City,” and “Powerless.” On the pilot side, the network has ordered “A.P. Bio” from Lorne Michaels and Seth Meyers, “Rise” from Jason Katims, virtual reality thriller “Reverie,” and military drama “The Brave” (formerly “For God and Country”) to series.",

        "text": "\n\nWarning: Spoilers ahead! Do not proceed if you haven't watched Thursday's Riverdale!\n\nOne of Riverdale's biggest mysteries was answered on Thursday, as it was revealed that Jason Blossom's killer was none other than his own father, Clifford Blossom!\n\nArchie (KJ Apa), Jughead (Cole Sprouse), Betty (Lili Reinhart), Veronica (Camila Mendes), and Kevin (Casey Cott) spent the episode doing some amateur sleuthing after Jughead's father, F.P. Jones (Skeet Ulrich) was arrested for, and later confessed to, Jason's murder. They discovered part of the truth, that Jason was shot and dumped in a freezer in the basement of the Southside Serpents' bar, but a video on a flash drive found in Jason's letterman jacket ultimately revealed the shocking truth, that it was Clifford (Barclay Hope), and not F.P., who pulled the trigger.\n\nRELATED: 'Riverdale' Stars Dish on Archie's New Romance and Molly Ringwald's Grand Debut\n\nTo get to the bottom of the morose truth behind Jason's death (and that extra incest twist!) ET hopped on the phone with EP Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa to discuss the who, what and why behind Riverdale's inciting incident.\n\nCan you talk to me about your decision to reveal the identify of Jason Blossom's killer in Riverdale's penultimate episode rather than the finale?\n\nRAS: I had a meeting with Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter, who are executive producers on the show... [we were] talking about the last few episodes and I said, 'Then we'll reveal the murderer in the finale.' And Greg said, 'I think you should reveal it in the penultimate, because when you invest in these characters the way you have this year, you're going to want to be able to see the aftermath. You're going to be surprised by how much story you have to tell on the other side of it.' And the second he said that I was like, 'Oh my gosh, that's exactly right!'\n\nWhen we brought it up to the studio and the network, there were some raised eyebrows and I said, 'This is Greg's idea and we really agree on this,' and then I threw out what was going to be in the finale so that they knew there was enough mystery and exciting stuff happening and then everyone got really on board, but it sort of makes for a very breathless episode 12.\n\nThe CW\n\nWhen it comes to who killed Jason, was it always your intention from the very beginning to have it be his own father?\n\nRAS: Yes, Mr. Blossom was always it... We went into [the season] with three likely candidates: one was F.P. Jones, one was Hiram Lodge... and then the last was Clifford Blossom. As the season progressed, we kind of added Hal Cooper to the mix of someone who very possibly could have killed Jason.\n\nOur thesis for this show is this dark take on the Archie characters, and the Archie world that people thought they knew was a place of sunny, happy kids and families, where everyone is protected and everyone is safe. So the most transgressive, the most taboo, the darkest act that could happen is a parent killing their own child. And he also sort of, we discovered, had the greatest secret that he was hiding and he had the biggest motive. That's sort of how we landed on him.\n\nRELATED: Mark Consuelos Joins Season 2 of 'Riverdale' as Veronica's Father\n\nSeems like there's more to the story -- are we going to discover the reasons why Clifford killed his son?\n\nRAS: Absolutely! Episode 112 is the who-dunnit, and episode 113 is the 'Why did he do it?' A lot more mysteries start rolling out from there.\n\nLet's talk about the Blossom family twist with the Coopers – I'm going to call them the Bloopers – When did you decide to do that and can you talk about the cousin-cest of it all?\n\nRAS: Very early on that was in the pitch, that it was going to be revealed that the reason the families didn’t want Jason and Polly to be together was because – though they were somewhat distantly related – they were blood relatives and of course, that's just such a gothic trope... People thought that we were breaking the incest taboo with Cheryl this season, and I love that the twist isn’t that it was Cheryl and Jason, it was Jason and Polly. And again, in our sort of darker universe, that's one of darkest kind of roses in the vase.\n\nThe CW\n\nTV: 6 Reasons Why 'Riverdale' Is the New Teen Drama We've Been Waiting For\n\nCan you talk about the decision behind Clifford hanging himself? Obviously that takes away the vindication of watching that person get punished for the crime.\n\nRAS: I would say two things: stay tuned for the finale and remember, we didn’t see Clifford hang himself. We just saw Clifford hanging there.\n\nHell hath no fury like a Blossom woman scorned?\n\nRAS: Correct, correct, and the one thing that you won't find out in 12 is that the evil things we know Clifford has been doing are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nRiverdale's season finale airs next Thursday at 9 p.m. ET/PT on The CW.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Molly Ringwald on Playing Archie's Mom on 'Riverdale,' What Advice She Gives Her Young Co-Stars\n\n",

        "text": "May 7, 2018\n\nBirth Control and Blood Clots: Know Your Risk\n\nThere are more than 60 million women of child-bearing age in the United States, and the majority of them report using some form of birth control. In fact, the birth control pill is their number one choice. While research shows that the birth control pill is safe and effective, the pill can carry risks like any other prescription medication. It is important for women to know their risks for blood clots, and to understand their options for birth control.\n\nOne risk associated with birth control pills – or any form of hormonal birth control that contains estrogen, including the pill, patch, or ring – is a deadly blood clot. The use of birth control pills with estrogen increases a woman’s risk for blood clots three-fold, and some of the newer birth control pills women use pose a risk two-times greater than older birth control pills. The use of patches and rings containing estrogen poses a risk double that of birth control pills. Women with a clotting disorder, a previous blood clot, or a family history of blood clots are at an even greater risk for blood clots.\n\nJoin the National Blood Clot Alliance (NBCA) during National Women’s Health Week (NWHW), May 13-19, 2018, as we work together with the Alexandra L. Rowan Memorial Foundation to provide women with life-saving information about birth control and blood clots, and to help them determine, along with their doctor, their risk for blood clots and their best birth control options. Together, we are encouraging women to visit Women & Blood Clots for more information about birth control and blood clots. Even if you are a woman at risk for blood clots, it is still possible for you to plan your family as you choose, by understanding your risk for blood clots and taking these simple steps to reduce your risk:\n\nLearn more about birth control and blood clot risks by visiting Women & Blood Clots\n\nComplete the Risk Assessment and discuss their results and birth control options with their doctor\n\nTalk to their doctor about any personal or family history of blood clots, and their existing risk for blood clot\n\nEach year, up to 900,000 people are affected by blood clots, and about 100,000 people will die because of blood clots. However, many of these deaths can be prevented simply by sharing life-saving information. Women in particular face specific risks for blood clots that span their entire lives. In addition to the risk for blood clots connected to hormonal birth control, women are also at risk during pregnancy and childbirth, and when estrogen is used in the treatment of menopause symptoms later in life.\n\nTo learn more about women and blood clot risks, signs and symptoms, and prevention, please visit and share www.womenandbloodclots.org.\n\nWhat is Women’s Health Week?\n\nNational Women’s Health Week is a special observance led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women’s Health. The goal is to empower women to make their health a priority. The week also serves as a time to help women understand what steps they can take to improve their health throughout the entire year. National Women’s Health Week kicks off on Mother’s Day, May 13, and is celebrated through May 19, 2018.\n\nNew this Year: Women and Blood Clots on Twitter\n\nTweet, Tweet: NBCA is excited to announce the launch of our brand new Women & Blood Clots Twitter account, where we will share important content singularly focused on information, news, and stories specific to women’s health and blood clots.

        "text": "Saturday Night Live fans hoping to see Melissa McCarthy rip into Sean Spicer right at the top of the show were in for something of a wait. McCarthy was absent entirely from the show’s cold open, and chose to focus on an apolitical topic, Mother’s Day, during her first sketch of the evening. McCarthy also defied expectations by largely ignoring the fact that this is her fifth time hosting Saturday Night Live. The show has a history of making a big deal of a host’s induction into the Five-Timer’s Club—but, perhaps because McCarthy made such fuss over almost getting there last year, S.N.L. decided to take a pass on bringing it up in the monologue.\n\nMcCarthy did, however, acknowledge some show history when she took an unsuspecting mom from the audience on a backstage tour that included cameos from a pantsless Alec Baldwin, as well as Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds (or, as McCarthy calls them, “the Livelys”). But the real star of that tour was the llama McCarthy encountered in the hallway. For more on why that particular animal is so significant, you can go here. Suffice to say, that wasn’t McCarthy’s first llama rodeo.",

        "text": "Not since Alicia Machado became the breakout star of the first presidential debate seven months ago—that’s half a century in Trump news cycle years—have the disparate worlds of pageantry and politics been so intertwined. Kára McCullough, our new reigning Miss USA, sparked controversy during Sunday night’s crowning due to her polarizing opinions on two separate issues: feminism and health care. Unlike so many of our elected politicians, McCullough’s soundbites were definitive, articulate, and to the point. But it was the content of McCullough’s politics, not her delivery, that left viewers sounding off on social media well into Monday morning. To recap, Miss District of Columbia became an unconventional alt-right darling by insisting that health care is a privilege, not a right. “I’m definitely going to say it is a privilege,” McCullough offered during the 30-second question and answer portion of the pageant. “As a government employee, I am granted health care and I see firsthand that to have health care, you need to have jobs.”\n\nMuch to the chagrin of Twitter eggs everywhere, the 25-year-old McCullough has since clarified her position on health care, explaining on Good Morning America that, “I am privileged to have health care and I do believe that it should be a right, and I hope and pray moving forward that health care is a right for all worldwide.” But McCullough is less likely to backtrack on her other controversial opinion of the night—the revelation that she self-identifies not as a feminist, but as an equalist. “I try not to consider myself this die-hard, like, I don’t really care about men,” she infamously insisted on Sunday night’s broadcast. During a victory tour interview at the top of New York’s Empire State Building, a wind-blown McCullough (complete with sash and crown) doubles down on her decision to identify as an equalist. “I’m just about being equal,” McCullough tells The Daily Beast, before insisting that, “I’m all about women’s rights.”\n\nAs a scientist at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with a degree in radiochemistry, McCullough has experience succeeding in a traditionally male-dominated field. In fact, she’s consistently spoken out about the importance of supporting women and girls in STEM, a platform that, for many, made her reluctance to call herself a feminist even more surprising. Still, McCullough insists, “I do want to see women flourish in just every aspect of life, whether it is in the medical sciences, or whether it’s in the government agencies and in STEM. I’m just saying in total we have to look at ourselves as, ‘we are equal.’” McCullough pauses and smiles before reaching for a pageant conclusion: “Women have made so many strides, and I’m looking forward to this next generation of women coming up.”\n\nEqualism aside, McCullough has been heralded as an outstanding role model on multiple fronts: not just as a black female scientist, but as a pageant beauty who insists on wearing her natural curls. McCullough concedes that in a time when images of natural black hair are still under-represented in pop culture, her decision was, of course, a deliberate one. “When I came to the conclusion to wear my hair natural, I wanted to be authentic,” she explains. “And I feel the most liberated and happy with my natural curly hair. Typically, you don’t really see women on the pageant stage with their natural hair. You’re always told to straighten your hair, that it looks more professional, it looks more put together.” McCullough stops just short of explaining the racism intrinsic to this particular brand of pageant advice—we are at an Empire State Building press junket, after all—and chooses her next words carefully. “I wasn’t necessarily trying to challenge the status quo,” she continues. “I just wanted to be comfortable. And that’s the message that I want to send to so many young women: do what makes you comfortable.”\n\nTen years ago, Miss USA would most likely be answering questions about her exercise routine or her favorite home-cooked meal. But, perhaps given the pageant’s history as a part of Donald Trump’s extensive entertainment portfolio, politics appear to have become a part of the competition. McCullough seems up to the challenge of wearing the crown during one of the most turbulent political moments in recent memory. In fact, she’s excited that Sunday’s Miss USA amounted to more than just channel surfing fodder. “We’re starting a conversation!” She exclaims. “We’re pressing on issues that are prominent in our nation right now…Everyone has an opinion, and I’m glad.”\n\nMcCullough insists that while “I don’t have a political agenda, I’m not trying to be a politician,” she’s open to using her platform to discuss more political issues in the future. “If matters are pressing on my heart, and I feel as if I’m the one involved in that type of situation, then sure, I’ll speak out about it,” she offers, before concluding that, “I’m just trying to go with the flow.”\n\nAs for her personal reaction to all of the backlash her pageant responses elicited, from doting conservatives to disappointed liberals, our reigning Miss USA has a perfectly patriotic answer: “That’s what social media’s about, and that’s what America’s about.” Land of freedom of expression, and home of the tweets.",

She now says \"it should be a right\" after previously calling it a privilege.\n\nMiss District of Columbia USA Kara McCullough competes during the Miss USA contest Sunday, May 14, 2017, in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I am privileged to have health care and I do believe that it should be a right,\" the 25-year-old beauty queen said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"I hope and pray moving forward that health care is a right for all worldwide.\"\n\n\"I just want people to see where I was coming from. Having a job, I have to look at health care like it is a privilege.\"\n\nMcCullough, a chemist who works for the government at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, previously said affordable health care was a \"privilege\" during Sunday's question-and-answer rounds.\n\n\"I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege,\" she told host Julianne Hough during the competition. \"As a government employee, I am granted health care and I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs,\" she said at the time. \"So therefore, we need to continue to cultivate this environment that we're given the opportunity to have health care as well as jobs to all the American citizens worldwide.\"\n\n\"I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege.\" Listen to your new #MissUSA talk about healthcare in the USA. pic.twitter.com/CzPBeaTYHO — Miss USA & Miss Teen USA (@MissUSA) May 15, 2017\n\nThe remark ignited political divides over President Donald Trump and the Republican Party's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Trump previously co-owned the Miss Universe Organization, which operates the Miss USA pageant.\n\nMcCullough told \"GMA\" Tuesday that she wasn't surprised by online criticisms of her health care comments, or for suggesting she's not a \"feminist\" because she believes women \"are just as equal as men, especially in the workplace.\" She said she prefers the term \"equalism\" to \"feminism.\"\n\n\"I believe that is what America is based on, like having opinions and views,\" she said Tuesday.\n\n\"For me, where I work at with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 'equalism' is more of a term of understanding that no matter your gender, you are still just kind of given the same accolades on your work,\" McCullough said today. \"I believe that if a person does a good job, they should be, you know, credited for that in a sense.\"\n\nMcCullough, who was born in Italy and raised in Virginia Beach, succeeded 2016 winner DeShauna Barber, also of the District of Columbia. Barber was the first-ever military member to be crowned Miss USA.\n\nMcCullough said she wants to inspire children to pursue careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. She graduated with a chemistry degree from South Carolina State University, where she was a member of the Honors College, the American Association of Blacks in Engineering and the Alpha Nu Sigma Honor Society; she also funds program encouraging Science Exploration for Kids.",

        "text": "The title of ABC’s upcoming “Grey’s Anatomy” spinoff has finally been revealed. The series, which comes from showrunner Stacy McKee, will be called “Station 19.”\n\nSeries executive producer Paris Barclay announced the title on Twitter on Thursday, saying, “Welcome all of them to @STATION19 #greysanatomy spin-off.”\n\nThe spinoff is set at Seattle Fire Station 19 in Seattle, Wash., in the same universe as “Grey’s Anatomy” and will see Jason George’s Dr. Ben Warren giving up his life as a surgeon to become a firefighter. With his new firehouse home being just blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial, producers of the show have said there may be opportunity to see some characters crossover between the two series.\n\nAt the Alphabet’s Television Critics Assn. press tour panel in early January 2018, McKee said they were still considering a few options for the show’s title. ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey noted that “coming up with a title is one of the most challenging things we do” and pointed out that the network executives at the time did not select a title for “Grey’s Anatomy” until right before that series debuted in 2005, either.\n\n“We really want to make sure that what we settle on is perfect,” Dungey said.\n\n“Station 19,” which falls under Shonda Rhimes’ Shondaland banner, stars George, Jaina Lee Ortiz, Grey Damon, Barrett Doss, Alberto Frezza, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre and Miguel Sandoval.\n\nOrtiz also announced the title on Twitter, with a little bonus video from the cast:\n\n“Station 19” will premiere with a special two-hour event on ABC Mar. 22 before taking its usual “TGIT” time slot of 9 p.m. on Mar. 29.",

But the British singer really enjoyed trying out puns while talking about the story involving hackers threatening to release Pirates of the Caribbean 5 unless a ransom was paid.\n\nWATCH: Harry Styles Dodges Kendall Jenner Mentions, Teases ‘Carpool Karaoke’ Segment on ‘The Late Late Show’\n\n“They could release this movie illegally. I guess you would say it’s a pirated video,” he quipped. “They’re holding Pirates of the Caribbean for ransom. Sounds to me like they’re charging them an arm and a peg. If Disney pays this ransom, they could go into Johnny Debt.”\n\nNot to be outdone, Corden spent time backstage rocking a tight bright red suit, white cowboy boots, and a butterfly tattoo on his chest.\n\n“Just a little something I put together,” Corden quipped as Styles continued to host the show.\n\nThe “Sign of the Times” crooner went on to perform his new single, “Carolina,” and read out some “Side Effects” of going solo.\n\n“Those side effects may include – having to be the cute one, having to also be the sulky one, but it’s hard because you’re also the cute one and there’s nothing really cute about being sulky,” he joked. “Having to be the dangerous one. That’s hard because you’re already cute and sulky and people aren’t really scared of sad little cutie pies. Having to be the talented one. All this time you spend trying to balance cute, sulky, and dangerous is really eaten up your schedule and it makes it hard to refine your talents.”\n\nWATCH: Harry Styles Addresses Whether 'Two Ghosts' Is About Taylor Swift: 'It's Pretty Self-Explanatory'\n\nBut Styles’ favorite side effect came last when he noted, “Getting to take up the entire album cover with just a picture of you in a bubble bath, which is something you’ve been pitching unsuccessfully to the band for years.”\n\nStyles’ new self-titled album is no. 1 across the globe and features a photo of his shirtless back in a bathtub.

ROFL\n\n“You were a lot nicer at the pool,” Daniel says.\n\nAshlee says it’s more like doing charity work than having a date.\n\n“I’m not going to lie Ashlee. I think you struck out with me.

        "text": "The finale of The Bachelorette has sparked another lead from the ABC reality dating franchise to speak out candidly about how her own finale was edited by show producers.\n\nRachel Lindsay, the historic star of The Bachelorette‘s 2017 cycle, got engaged to winner Bryan Abasolo on her season 13 finale. Now, however, she is opening up to say, “I was denied my on-camera happy ending” and “labeled an angry black female.”\n\nLindsay was the first black lead of the long-running franchise, which just wrapped its 14th season of The Bachelorette on Monday night. Lindsay remains the only black star in the franchise’s combined 26 seasons, and though her long overdue casting was praised and her season was initially celebrated for its diversity, the cycle ended up being criticized for race-baiting for drama.\n\nIn a blog post about Becca Kufrin’s finale for Us Weekly, Lindsay details how her TV ending played out differently than the one that just aired. Kufrin accepted a proposal from her winner, Garrett Yrigoyen, who has emerged as a controversial pick given his past social media history of liking several memes espousing offensive rhetoric.\n\nLindsay, who remains happily engaged to Abasolo, says the pretaped portion of the latest finale gave Kufrin and Yrigoyen the “true definition” of a happy ending. After the proposal, the live aftershow saw the couple return to discuss their journey off-camera, including the Instagram scandal. But Lindsay says what she endured on the night of her finale was much worse.\n\n“Becca did not sit on stage for three hours and watch the finale for the first time in front of a live audience,” Lindsay wrote, recalling how her part of the live post-finale special, After the Final Rose, cut into the pretaped portion. “Becca did not have to deal with someone telling her she would live a mediocre life. Becca did not have to deal with being baited with real-time questions about her emotions watching certain scenes. Nope, that was me.”\n\nAs viewers will recall, much of Lindsay’s finale centered around the departure of her runner-up, Peter Kraus, and she criticized the show for focusing more on the breakup than the proposal.\n\n“Let’s just be honest, Becca did not have the finale that I had,” she continued. “There was no controversy and she was not put in a position to face any. She was protected and I was placed on display for three hours and labeled an angry black female. And there will always be that stigma attached to my finale because it has been said that when truth is blurred by misinformation, perception becomes reality and all is lost.”\n\nLindsay summed up what was meant to be a finale recap by challenging ABC and show producers to do better.\n\n“The Bachelor franchise does believe in happy endings — some people get an on-camera happy ending, some people get on off-camera happy ending, and some people get both,” she says. “For Becca, I truly hope she gets both. As for my happy ending, it was not demonstrated within the confines of your television screens, but I am living it every day in real life. So in regards to a future on-camera happy ending and whether or not I will get married on TV, I have no idea but they damn sure owe us one.”\n\nAt the time, Lindsay said that a lot of her relationship with Abasolo was left on the cutting-room floor because their relationship was drama-free. Instead, much of the focus was on Lindsay sending Kraus home early over his hesitance about proposing. “Bryan was the person,” she said of why she sent Kraus home. “I’m only in love with one person through that entire season. I wanted that proposal to be all about Bryan. I wanted him to be the focus.”\n\nThis year’s Bachelor, Arie Luyendyk Jr., also spoke out after his season wrapped to say that he felt “betrayed” by how show producers edited his controversial finale, which resulted in Kufrin being named as the Bachelorette.",

        "text": "WARNING: The following article contains spoilers from tonight’s Riverdale season 2 premiere. Read at your own risk!\n\nThe cliffhanger that’s had Riverdale fans on edge all summer was finally answered in the season premiere: Luke Perry’s Fred Andrews survived his gunshot wound. The father of Archie (KJ Apa) was touch-and-go for much of the episode but pulled through in the final moments. Not so lucky was Miss Grundy (Sarah Habel): Archie’s music teacher and lover was shockingly killed in the final moments by the Black Hood.\n\nEW talked to Perry about surviving to season 2 and what Hiram’s arrival means for Fred.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: When did you first learn Fred would be shot?\n\nLUKE PERRY: We were about three or four days into the episode and what [show creator and EP Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa] wanted to have happened at the end of the season, for various reasons, he wasn’t able to get it together and had to come up with a new ending. He had to come up with something else and he came to me and he goes, “This is what I’m thinking is going to be compelling.” And I said, “Alright!”\n\nHe told me that he was planning on introducing Hiram but they couldn’t find the right actor.\n\nYep, that was what it was. I was like, “Hey I know how this works: I saw Game of Thrones and people get their heads cut off on TV! You can’t scare me! I’m not afraid of that s—, Roberto!” That’s what I said.\n\nDid he tell you that you would still be alive though?\n\nI didn’t want him to tell me. I wanted him to leave the door open for what he creatively thought was best and if that means one thing then that’s what it means and if it means something else then that’s what it means. I like to take the creative chance and I don’t like to operate from a place of fear. I was like, “Let’s see where this goes.”\n\nHow did they keep this a secret in getting you on set? You have so much paparazzi now.\n\nThey’ve been disguising me as Madelaine [Petsch, who plays Cheryl Blossom]. Long red wigs and stuff like that. I told them [the hair] needed to be long enough to cover the beard so we went with Mads.\n\nDean Buscher/The CW\n\nThis whole episode reminded me of an old Beverly Hills, 90210 episode when Dylan crashed his Porsche and had all these weird dreams in the hospital. Was that an homage?\n\nI don’t know. I never know with Roberto. He has such a comprehensive knowledge of television and the history thereof. It very well could have been. That episode was called “The Dreams of Dylan McKay” — I remember that. It was like all his bad dreams were coming true for him.\n\nSo now that we know Fred is alive and awake, how will this change him?\n\nI think Fred is traumatized. I really do. I think he’s sort of going through the motions and he hasn’t connected back into what his life is. I can only imagine if something like that were to happen to you, you hit the pause button in your life and it makes you think about a lot of different things. He definitely comes out of it a different guy.\n\nWhat’s his relationship going to be like with Hermione (Marisol Nichols) now that Hiram (Mark Consuelos) is back?\n\nWell you know with triangles they get a little pointy! That’s what happens. We’re gonna start digging into that here pretty soon. She’s the one with the problem — she was the one who was married. I didn’t do anything wrong.\n\nDo you know what the Black Hood’s endgame is? He’s clearly targeting people in the Andrews’ circle based on Fred and the murder of Miss Grundy.\n\nI do not. Harkening back to a question you asked me earlier about how do we keep everything such a secret, Roberto keeps it a secret from us! I think again, with all the technologies and opportunities to have your story blown up today, he’s protective over his material.\n\nRiverdale airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.",

But when Bailey (Chandra Wilson) puts the hospital on lockdown to find him, Keith resorts to starting a fire to set of the sprinkler system and trigger an automatic release of all the locks in the building.\n\nTo stop Keith from taking a young girl, Erin (Big Little Lies‘ Darby Camp), with him as a hostage of sorts, Edwards douses him in flammable liquid and hides with the girl as the rapist becomes engulfed in flames. He sets off a calamity as he stumbles toward flammable tanks in a nearby room. Edwards, rushing to move Keith to a safer location, is too late as the tanks explode and causes a hospital-wide evacuation.\n\nEdwards saves herself and Erin as she reaches the roof of the burning building and quickly begins mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, despite severe burns on her arms, face and legs.\n\nFROM PEN: Grey’s Anatomy’s Chandra Wilson Opens Up About Daughter’s Mysterious Vomiting Syndrome —and There’s No Cure\n\nIn the finale, doctors find her and Erin on the roof and quickly rush the young girl into surgery. Edwards, enduring the agony of her wounds and realizing she wants to live her life, tells Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), her mentor, that she won’t be returning to the hospital after she heals.\n\n“I quit,” she says.\n\nBut fans of Hinton need not fear saying goodbye to the actress for long. The 35-year-old has been cast in Six Feet Under and True Blood producer Alan Ball’s upcoming HBO family drama.\n\nGrey’s Anatomy will return in the fall for season 14.",

Between my surgeries and hormonal intervention, I was disease-free. That doesn’t mean it can never return, but for now, once my sutures have been removed and my bruises have changed from blue to yellow to green to gone, I will be healthy.”\n\nBut her condition took a turn after the Met Gala, and she thanked fans for their support after her hospital stay.\n\n“Thank you for all the love & concern that’s been pouring in since Tuesday,” Dunham wrote on Instagram. “Although I’m much healthier than I was a year ago, complications arose from my most recent endometriosis surgery.”\n\n“I’ll always be proud of those Met Gala pics — not just because I felt beautiful, surrounded by art and magic, hugging my best friend tightly, but because they’re evidence that women contain steely multitudes.”",

        "text": "The collective internet seems to have already passed judgment on Katy Perry's new track, \"Swish Swish,\" which is raising eyebrows over its possible lyrical shots at Taylor Swift. Perry was even asked by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Friday whether this song, off her upcoming Witness album, was about \"anyone we know.\" While the pop diva remained cryptic, she explained the meaning of \"Swish Swish\" is \"liberation\" from bullies.\n\n\"I think it's a great anthem for people to use whenever someone's trying to hold you down or bully you,\" she said. \"That's kind of what this record is about, it's just like [a] 360-degree liberation.\" If \"Chained to the Rhythm\" was about \"political liberation\" and \"Bon Appétit\" was a \"sexual liberation,\" then Perry calls \"Swish Swish\" \"the liberation from all the negative that doesn't serve you.\"\n\nPerry directed her fans to the segment on social media Saturday morning. \"Here's some of the tea and a biscuit,\" she tweeted.\n\nSince \"Swish Swish\" dropped on Thursday, listeners, including Swift pal Ruby Rose, pointed to the lyrics as a diss track. \"I've always stood up for the people I love and against things I think are cheap or mean spirited. That's not new. You have to follow your [heart emoji],\" Rose wrote in a series of tweets.\n\nPerry and Swift have reportedly been feuding since an alleged spat over backup dancers a couple of years ago. Swift's 1989 hit \"Bad Blood\" has long been rumored to be a strike against Perry, and when asked by Entertainment Weekly if Witness included a response to the Swift song, Perry said it was \"not my question to answer—if it's about me.\"\n\nShe further explained, \"I think [my new album is] a very empowered record. There is no one thing that's calling out any one person. One thing to note is: You can't mistake kindness for weakness and don't come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that's not to any one person and don't quote me that it is, because it's not. It's not about that.\"\n\nWatch her latest explanation of \"Swish Swish\" on The Tonight Show above.",

        "text": "Still it’s hard not to see that S.N.L. has its favorite children. In 2002, the entire cast stopped to pay homage to Will Ferrell. When Andy Samberg and Kristen Wiig left the show in 2012, it was Wiig alone who got a massive, emotional farewell featuring Mick Jagger. (According to Lorne Michaels, Samberg and wasn’t quite sure about his departures at the time.) And in addition to their tearful farewells at the end of their episodes in 2013, Bill Hader and Fred Armisen each got goodbye sketches tailored to their particular tastes—a star-studded Stefon wedding for Hader and a musical-star-studded number for Armisen. And in 2014, a departing Seth Meyers was greeted by ghosts of “Weekend Update” past as he gave his final news report mid-season.\n\nYou could argue that Bayer, Moynihan, and certainly the under-used Zamata were never S.N.L. stars the way Ferrell, Wiig, Hader, Armisen, and Meyers were. They’re more on-par with the likes of Rachel Dratch, Chris Parnell, and Horatio Sanz who were all cut—without any on-air ado—for budgetary reasons in 2006. “It still stung a little because you don’t ever want to be let go,” Parnell told Vulture years later. “I was a little burnt out, so it was all right.”\n\nBut what’s also true about this new, well-watched era of Saturday Night Live is that the likes of Moynihan, Bayer, and Zamata have even less of a chance than they did before of breaking out the way stars of S.N.L. past did. S.N.L. hit ratings and critical gold this year by leaning heavily on Baldwin and Melissa McCarthy to recur in their show-stopping sketches. Baldwin joked during The Rock’s monologue this week, “What a season this has been. . .for me . . .I can’t take all the credit. What do you call those pale people who take the subway?” “The writers,” Johnson joked back. It was a funny acknowledgment of the excessive attention Baldwin has received, but the joke landed so well because it’s rooted in the truth that, even more than usual, the S.N.L. cast felt like supporting players this year. When The Rock’s episode of S.N.L. ended on the West Coast this week, an old re-run with Jim Carrey and, fittingly, Soundgarden, it was a shock to see the political cold open featuring Bob Dole, Ted Koppel, and Bill Clinton played entirely by existing cast members Darrell Hammond (doing double duty) and Norm McDonald. It’s easy to forget that, no pun intended, that was once the norm.\n\nThat shift of focus to celebrity guest stars became apparent in a recent Hollywood Reporter cover story when producer Steve Higgins said that after Baldwin was hired, he felt bad for “poor Darrell [Hammond],” who came out of S.N.L. retirement to replace Don Pardo as the show’s announcer in 2014, and played Trump for much of 2016. And writer Kent Sublette points out that if Melissa McCarthy hadn’t been tapped to play Sean Spicer, “it would have gone to Beck [Bennett]. He has an amazing impression. In fact, he reads Spicer for the read-through because Melissa’s not usually there.” With the exception of Kate McKinnon and, I’d argue, Kenen Thompson (by sheer dint of endurance), the S.N.L. talent isn’t rising up the ranks the way it once did. Even Leslie Jones—who has certainly become a household name—owes most of her fame to her own hustle outside of S.N.L. on social media and in last year’s Ghostbusters. Like Zamata, she’s rarely well-deployed in sketches.",

        "text": "Is Dwayne Johnson running for president in 2020? The actor has yet to confirm the widespread rumors of a presidential run, but on The Graham Norton Show recently he suggested why a campaign might be difficult. His co-star in the upcoming film Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Kevin Hart, he says, would “completely sabotage the campaign.”\n\n“Here’s the problem. It’s been very flattering that there’s been this really interesting uptick in public opinion wanting that to happen, but the problem is this guy to my right would completely sabotage the campaign,” Johnson said when asked about his political plans for 2020 during a group discussion with Hart, Jessica Chastain, Jack Black and Rebel Wilson.\n\nHart emphatically agreed: “100 percent.”\n\n“I will take you down. I don’t want it to happen because it would make you that much better than me, and I just don’t want that to happen,” he joked with his friend and co-star.\n\nWhen Norton pressed Chastain on whether she would be a “cheerleader” for Johnson, she said she definitely would. “Have you seen his Instagram?” she asked.\n\nRebel Wilson also chimed in, telling Norton she would be “prepared to donate” to a potential Johnson campaign.\n\nThe rumors of a Johnson presidential run picked up steam after the actor told GQ that he thinks a campaign is “a real possibility” in June. In October Johnson continued to fan the flames of fan speculation when he commented, “I think ‘The People’s President’ has a really nice ring to that. I’ll just say that,” on a panel at Los Angeles Comic Con.\n\nJohnson and Hart appeared on The Graham Norton Show to promote Jumanji, which will be released in theaters Dec. 20.",

        "text": "“When I read the script for Episode VIII, I went, ‘Oh my God, we’re going back?’ Because I said I was never going back,” Hamill told me when I sat down with him recently at his home in Malibu. He wondered, in vain, if they could drop him in by chopper this time, “which is so clueless of me, because there’s no landing pad, and it would mar the beauty of it all,” he said. Hamill is a youthful 65 but a sexagenarian nevertheless; whereas the fit young members of the crew were given 45 minutes to get up to the now iconic Rey-Luke meeting spot—carrying heavy equipment—Hamill was allotted an hour and a half, “and I had to stop every 10, 15 minutes to rest.”\n\nNone of this was offered up in the form of complaint. Hamill just happens to be a rambling, expansive talker—in his own way, as endearingly offbeat a character as his friend and on-screen twin sister, Carrie Fisher, who passed away suddenly and tragically last December. Like Fisher, Hamill was put on a diet-and-exercise regimen after he was reconscripted into the Star Wars franchise. (Harrison Ford was under less obligation, having retained his leading-man shape because he never stopped being a leading man.) Over a spartan snack plate of carrot sticks and hummus, the man behind Luke held forth at length on this subject.\n\nWatch the video below for a behind-the-scenes look at Annie Leibovitz’s photo shoot with The Last Jedi cast and crew.\n\n“You just cut out all the things you love,” he said. “Something as basic as bread and butter, which I used to start every meal with. Sugar. No more candy bars. No more stops at In-N-Out. It’s really just a general awareness, because in the old days I’d go, ‘Well, I’m not that hungry, but oh, here’s a box of Wheat Thins,’ and you don’t put the Wheat Thins in the same category as Lay’s potato chips, and yet I would sort of idly, absentmindedly eat these things while watching Turner Classic Movies, and ‘Oh, I ate the whole box!’ ”\n\nHamill had been dieting and training for 50 weeks before he learned, via the Episode VII script he finally received from Abrams, that he would not appear in the movie until its last scene, and in a nonspeaking part at that. On this, too, he has a lot of thoughts. Though he grants that the delayed-gratification reveal of Luke was a narrative masterstroke, he’d have done things differently if he’d had his druthers. Han Solo’s death scene, for example. Why couldn’t Luke have made his first appearance around then? In the finished film, the witnesses to Han’s death, at the hands of his own son, the brooding dark-side convert Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), are his longtime Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca, and the upstart Resistance fighters Rey and Finn (John Boyega).",

There is nothing I or anyone can do to take away the pain you are feeling or to make this better,” she began. “However, I extend my hand and heart and everything I possibly can give to you and yours, should you want or need my help in any way. The only thing we can do now is choose how we let this affect us and how we live our lives from here on out.”\n\n“I am sorry for the pain and fear that you must be feeling and for the trauma that you, too, must be experiencing,” she continued.\n\n“We will never be able to understand why events like this take place because it is not in our nature, which is why we shouldn’t recoil. We will not quit or operate in fear. We won’t let this divide us. We won’t let hate win.”\n\nGrande then revealed her plans to return to Manchester to perform a benefit concert.\n\n“I don’t want to go the rest of the year without being able to see and hold and uplift my fans, the same way they continue to uplift me. Our response to this violence must be to come closer together, to help each other, to love more, to sing louder and to live more kindly and generously than we did before,” she said.\n\n“I’ll be returning to the incredibly brave city of Manchester to spend time with my fans and to have a benefit concert in honor of and to raise money for the victims and their families.\n\n“I want to thank my fellow musicians and friends for reaching out to be a part of our expression of love for Manchester. I will have details to share with you as soon as everything is confirmed.”\n\nImage: Ariana Grande via Instagram\n\nThe Side To Side singer said the attack on her and her fans was the exact opposite of what she wanted her Dangerous Woman tour to be – a place for them to feel safe and be carefree.\n\n“From the day we started putting the Dangerous Woman Tour together, I said that this show, more than anything else, was intended to be a safe space for my fans.\n\n“A place for them to escape, to celebrate, to heal, to feel safe and to be themselves. To meet their friends they’ve made online. To express themselves. This will not change that.\n\n“When you look into the audience at my shows, you see a beautiful, diverse, pure, happy crowd. Thousands of people, incredibly different, all there for the same reason, music.”\n\nShe urged people to find comfort in music following the attack.\n\n“Music is something that everyone on Earth can share. Music is meant to heal us, to bring us together, to make us happy. So that is what it will continue to do for us.\n\n“We will continue in honor of the ones we lost, their loved ones, my fans, and all affected by this tragedy. They will be on my mind and in my heart every day and I will think of them with everything I do for the rest of my life.”\n\nGrande cancelled scheduled shows in London and some European cities in the next week.

        "text": "Article Summary\n\nX\n\nTo make a neat and tidy top knot bun, comb your hair back from your forehead and pull it into a high ponytail, close to the top of your head. Secure the ponytail in place with an elastic hairband. Next, divide the hair into two equal sections. To make them smoother and easier to work with, work a little mousse or styling cream through each of the sections. Grab the sections in both hands and twist them around each other, passing one over the other until the entire length of your ponytail makes one long, twisted section. Take the twisted hair and wrap it clockwise around the elastic at the base of your ponytail. Tuck the end of the hair under the topknot, then pin the knot in place with several bobby pins that match your hair color. Spritz the bun with hairspray to give it extra hold and prevent fly-aways. If you want a messier, more voluminous topknot, back-comb your ponytail before you wrap it. Put your hair into a ponytail like you would for a regular topknot, then divide it into four sections. Grab each section one at a time and hold it straight up, then gently work a comb backwards down the length of the hair to tease it up. When you’re done, use a brush to gently smooth the very top layer of the ponytail, which will make your backcombed hair easier to work with. Take your ponytail and wrap it clockwise around the elastic hairband, then tuck the end of the ponytail under the elastic. Pin your messy bun in place with several bobby pins that match your hair. You can also create a fuller-looking topknot using a hair doughnut. Slide the doughnut over the base of your ponytail, then backcomb your hair like you would for a messy topknot. Wrap your hair clockwise around the doughnut, making sure to cover the doughnut completely. Tuck the end of the ponytail under the doughnut and pin it in place with bobby pins. Spray on some hairspray to help keep your topknot in place. If you want to learn more from our Cosmetologist co-author, like how to use a hair donut to help shape your bun, keep reading!",

We don’t even have a TV in our bedroom; we’re that couple. And no computers in the bed.”\n\nGetty Images\n\nShe added that she and her country crooner hubby are particularly strict about what projects they choose, now that they’re parents to daughters Sunday Rose, 10, and Faith, 7. “The thing you really learn when you have children and a career — and particularly when you’re an older mother — is the preciousness of time, and therefore trying to balance everything and be willing to say no to things,” she told the publication, before adding that she’s “not willing” to miss bedtime.\n\nIn a new interview, Keith admitted that he’s so head-over-heels for his wife that watching her character, Celeste Wright, be abused on the hit show Big Little Lies was difficult. “It’s hard because she really tells her story,” Keith admitted to The London Evening Standard. “I love how committed she is, though, in telling her stories. She had the bruises to prove it.”\n\nGetty Images\n\nDespite the agony he felt watching his wife, he’s very supportive of her craft. In fact, he even creates his schedule based around where she’s filming. “We have a tutor that travels with us, so if Nic’s shooting a film for any long period of time, even if I’m touring, we can almost always relocate to wherever she is. And I’ll go to and from there. We just make the rhythm work so we can be together.” boundaries\n\nBack in 2016, Keith gushed about the life he’s built with his adorable family. “Meeting her and getting married wasn’t life-changing, it was life-beginning,” he told CBS News. “It was literally, like, ‘OK, life starts.’”",

This was not an easy decision for either of us because we do love each other very much but sometimes God has other plans,\" the pair tells PEOPLE in an exclusive statement. \"This is the route we have decided to take, and all we request is that you respect our privacy in this delicate matter. Divorce is never easy for anyone, especially not such a public one.\"\n\nLillian Vilchez and Tom Wilson. Courtesy A&E\n\nThe pair add that they \"remain best of friends and will always be there for each other even if we are not married. We plan to continue to grow our relationship, just without a piece of paper binding us together. We appreciate all the love and support you have all shown us during our marriage and hope you continue to support us during this time.\"\n\nLillian Vilchez and Tom Wilson. Courtesy A&E\n\nAfter their split was announced, Vilchez shared the couple's joint statement to Instagram — where she added \"@tomyachts Still love you though!\" — and also opened up about their decision to call it quits.\n\n\"Someone can be madly in love with you and still not be ready. They can love you in a way you have never been loved and still not join you on the bridge. And whatever their reasons you must leave. Because you never ever have to inspire anyone to meet you on the bridge,\" she penned in her post.\n\n\"You never ever have to convince someone to do the work to be ready. There is more extraordinary love, more love that you have never seen, out here in this wide and wild universe. And there is the love that will be ready,\" she concluded.\n\nFROM PEN: Christina and Tarek El Moussa's Divorce Has Not Stopped Their Business Relationship\n\nVilchez, a 25-year-old real estate agent, and Wilson, a 29-year-old yacht interior specialist, met for the first time as they walked down the aisle on Lifetime's hit social experiment show (produced by Kinetic content).\n\n\"They tried to make it work. They really, really did,\" a source close to the couple — who wed on April 2, 2016 — tells PEOPLE. \"I've never seen two people fight for their marriage like they have, but at the end of the day, they realized they are moving in different directions. On paper, they are truly the perfect match but life got in the way.\"\n\nThough the duo certainly had many sweet moments as newlyweds, they also butted heads over their future together, with Vilchez often feeling insecure about her husband's commitment to their marriage.\n\nThe current season of Married at First Sight airs Thursdays (9 p.m. ET) on Lifetime.",

She helped PETA lobby the New York City Council to pass bills increasing licensing fees for unneutered animals and prohibiting dogs from being chained outside, she hosted PETA’s Passover hotline to promote vegan ham — or “pork even a Jew can eat” — and she helped PETA unveil Melissa’s anti-fur billboard in Times Square.\n\nEvery year, more than 6 million dogs and cats end up in U.S. animal shelters, and half of them must be euthanized because there aren’t enough good homes for them. Countless more end up on the street, where they may starve, freeze, get hit by cars, or endure abuse. PETA encourages caring people to adopt from local animal shelters and never buy from breeders or pet stores, which only exacerbate the homeless-animal overpopulation crisis.",

They’re pretty strict. Two phone calls a week, 10 minutes [for each phone call].”\n\nEdwards’ father, Larry, added that the reality star “just knew he needed to go.”\n\n“He picked the [rehab] place. He wants to do better, he wants to get better,” Larry explained.\n\nJen added, “It is a relapse or a slip, whatever they want to call it. I think that’s why he realized before it gets out of control he needs to get a hold on it.”\n\n“It was about to spiral bad,” Standifer said. “Right before he left he said his kids deserve to have the healthiest dad. What better time to go than now?”\n\nJen and Larry asked Standifer, who has 4-year-old son Hudson from a previous relationship, how she was feeling during her pregnancy without Edwards by her side.\n\nMackenzie Edwards/Instagram\n\n“If I did not love Ryan I would call him the most selfish a—— ever for missing this,” she said. “[But] if he’s going to miss [the baby] being born but be healthy forever, what more could I ask for?”\n\nThe conversation soon turned to Edwards’ 10-year-old son, Bentley, whom he shares with ex-girlfriend Maci Bookout, and whether he knew his father was in rehab.\n\nLarry and Jen said Bentley and Bookout were not aware of Edwards being in rehab but explained they were waiting for the right time to tell him.\n\n“We are going to talk to him,” Jen said. “It makes me sad because he’s going to miss his dad. I’m not sure what Maci’s talked to him about or what he’s heard, but I haven’t told her that he’s back in rehab.”\n\n“I want to talk to Bentley and explain to him: Just because you’re an addict doesn’t make you a bad person,” she continued. “I don’t really know how much to tell a 9½-year-old.” (Bentley was 9½ at the time of filming but turned 10 on Oct. 27.)\n\nLarry said he had no qualms about being open with Bentley about his father’s struggles with addiction.\n\n“I’m going to be totally honest [with Bentley], that’s my plan,” Larry explained. “But I want him to hear it from us first before he hears it from anybody else.”\n\nEdwards checked into rehab in early October, according to Us Weekly. Standifer gave birth to their first child together — son Jagger Ryan Edwards — on Oct. 9, PEOPLE confirmed.\n\nThe reality TV pair secretly tied the knot before Edwards headed to rehab back in May, and they exchanged vows at a church ceremony in November 2017.\n\nIn an April episode of Teen Mom OG, Mackenzie confirmed her pregnancy when she showed a positive test to producer Jeni, who quickly hugged and congratulated her.\n\nWhen asked if her husband was happy, Mackenzie said, “[He] was so excited, he couldn’t contain himself.”\n\nTeen Mom OG airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on MTV.",

We wish nothing but the best for each other, and ask for your support and understanding at this time.\"\n\nThe couple met on Higgins' season of The Bachelor, which premiered in January 2016. Higgins, 29, ultimately offered his final rose and proposed to Bushnell, 27 — but not without a little controversy after he famously told both finalists — Bushnell and JoJo Fletcher — that he loved them during the Fantasy Suites episode.\n\nNevertheless, the two did their best to overcome their issues together and Bushnell moved to Higgins' hometown of Denver shortly after going public with their engagement following the season finale, which aired in March.\n\nOf Higgins declaration of love to both women, Bushnell told PEOPLE exclusively at the time that \"post-filming was more of an emotional roller coaster than the actual show.\"\n\n\"I fall more in love with Ben every day and it's hard to separate what happened long ago and my current feelings,\" she said. \"It's confusing. It does wear on me.\"\n\n\"It hurts,\" she added. \"It's like, why did I have to go through that hurt? It's already a few months of confusion and tears and then to have to deal with it again. It's hard.\"\n\nHiggins, meanwhile, told PEOPLE he couldn't apologize \"for being honest or expressing what I thought was the best thing to express at the time.\"\n\n\"Don't get us wrong. Throughout this whole show airing and conversations we've had about decisions and life, it hasn't always been easy,\" he continued. \"But it's added a whole new level to our relationship.

But we are trying really hard and we love each other a lot.\"\n\n\"There are so many weird elements to being in a relationship after The Bachelor,\" said Bushnell. \"We've gotten in arguments like any other couple, but about some things that other couples wouldn't have to fight about, like the fact that we met when he was dating other women. You can say that's what I signed up for, but it's still real life and it's still hard.\"\n\nAnd overcoming trust issues that lingered after the Fletcher drama wasn't easy, either.\n\n\"For a long time, I was really angry for being blindsided,\" said Bushnell. \"And that resentment and anger affected our relationship much longer than it should have.\"\n\nUltimately, the two always maintained they were \"not in any rush\" to tie the knot.\n\n\"We're both ready to get married, but we haven't set a date because we want to make sure we're not doing it for anyone but ourselves,\" said Bushnell.\n\n\"We just want to do it on our own terms,\" added Higgins. \"I just want to look over at Lauren and know that she is completely filled with joy in that moment. … Love is what life is all about.\"",

Blige has been ordered to pay her estranged husband Martin “Kendu” Isaacs $30,000/month in temporary spousal support, according to various reports.\n\nThe singer, 46, filed for divorce in July 2016 after 12 years of marriage. Despite Blige’s attempts to argue that their prenuptial agreement waived any spousal support, she’ll have to pay Isaacs dating back to September, according to E! Online.\n\nIsaacs originally requested for $129,319 per month, but a judge ordered a lot less be paid.\n\nIn April, Blige claimed in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that Isaacs spent more than $420,000 during their marriage on “travel charges” that involved his girlfriend, not her.\n\nBlige also claimed that Isaacs drives a Mercedes that she pre-paid the lease on and that he refuses to turn over possession of her “Grammy and other achievement awards.”\n\nWATCH: Hillary Clinton Talks to Mary J. Blige About the Difficulties Women Face Being ‘Tough and Likable’\n\nThe singer said she had long been the only bread-winner in the family and that she is burdened with more than $10,000,000 in debt.\n\nWhile the couple does not have any children together, Blige has been a stepmother to Kendu’s children – Briana, Jordan and Nas – from a former relationship since they wed in 2003.\n\n“I am not responsible for supporting [Martin’s] parents and his children from another relationship which he lists as ongoing monthly expenses,” Blige stated in the court documents.\n\nTMZ first reported the news.",

        "text": "Another baby is joining Bachelor Nation. Bekah Martinez, who competed for Arie Luyendyk Jr.’s heart on season 22 of The Bachelor, revealed Wednesday that she is pregnant and expecting her first child with her boyfriend, Grayston Leonard.\n\nMartinez shared the news in an interview with PureWow. “I was in disbelief and thought, ‘Is this really happening?'” Martinez told the site. “I immediately called Grayston and then went across the street to the Dollar Tree and bought two more pregnancy tests. They, of course, were both positive.”\n\nAccording to Martinez, who has been dating Leonard for seven months, becoming a mother is “legitimately a dream come true.” The 23-year-old elaborated, “It’s the one thing that I’ve known with certainty for so long. I’ve gone back and forth on the idea of marriage and relationships, but I’ve always felt sure that I want to be a mom.”\n\nMartinez’s pregnancy announcement comes months after she was named a castmember on season five of Bachelor in Paradise, which just wrapped its season Tuesday night. Host Chris Harrison had announced her participation during the Bachelorette reunion show earlier this summer, but then her casting never materialized.\n\nIt was never explained why she opted not to do the show. Now, Martinez explains that her relationship with Leonard — and their forthcoming bundle of joy — got in the way.\n\n“I think pregnancy is better than Bachelor in Paradise,” she says. “Although I’m probably equally as sweaty, exhausted, nauseous, stressed out and emotional, at least I don’t have to worry about finding a man. I already have that one covered.”\n\nMartinez made headlines back in February when she appeared on a missing persons list while The Bachelor was still airing. Martinez’s mother reported her missing, telling police in November 2017 that she hadn’t communicated with her daughter after she supposedly left to work on a marijuana farm. Martinez later clarified the situation during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.\n\n“I just decided to go to the mountains with my friends for a couple weeks [after filming The Bachelor] and I was there for six or seven days without phone service, which I thought I was going to have phone service and I told my mother that I would,” she explained at the time. “I just had this weird feeling on the sixth or seventh day. ‘I need to go home now.’ So, I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents and then come to find out [that] only 12 hours before, my mother had called the Humboldt Sheriff’s Department saying that I was missing.”\n\nDuring her chat with PureWow, Martinez joked that she plans to keep her child out of the spotlight to avoid drama: “I don’t really want my child to get reported missing on a weed farm.”\n\nMartinez also made headlines in August when sexual harassment claims surfaced against Bachelor in Paradise star Leo Dottavio, who appeared on Becca Kufrin’s recent season of The Bachelorette.",

According to him, the secret to Kendall Jenner-worthy brows is not stressing about perfection. \"People get lost in this idea of having perfect brows and waxing and plucking and shaping. Sometimes the best thing for your brows is just to let them be,\" he says. Still, that doesn't mean he practices ahands-off approach when it comes to enhancing Jenner's arches.

        "text": "Tiger Woods announced Monday via Twitter that he’s getting professional help in the wake of his DUI arrest in May.\n\nThe golf great was found asleep at the wheel of his vehicle in Jupiter, Fla., on May 29. He was incoherent, but no alcohol was found in his system.\n\nWoods, who has undergone four back surgeries since 2014, told the arresting officers he had an adverse reaction to a mix of prescription drugs, which included Vicodin and Xanax.\n\nThe 14-time major champion tweeted that he’s dealing with a problem with prescription drugs.\n\n“I’m currently receiving professional help to manage my medications and the ways that I deal with back pain and a sleep disorder,” Woods said on social media. “I want to thank everyone for the amazing outpouring of support and understanding especially the fans and players on tour.”\n\nWoods, 41, is scheduled to be arraigned on the DUI charge on Aug. 9. He could qualify for a diversion program in which the DUI charge is downgraded to reckless driving, which results in probation, fine and other conditions such as taking a DUI course.\n\nAfter spending the night in jail, Woods quickly announced alcohol was not an issue, but rather a misuse of medications.\n\n“I want the public to know that alcohol was not involved,” Woods wrote. “What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. I didn’t realize the mix of medications affected me so strongly.”\n\nAfter missing 15 months, including the entire 2016 season, Woods attempted to return to professional golf last December.\n\nHis comeback lasted three tournaments before he was sidelined again with back problems, prompting the fourth surgery.\n\nJust days before the arrest, Woods wrote on his website that he was feeling much better and pain free.\n\n“It has been just over a month since I underwent fusion surgery on my back, and it is hard to express how much better I feel,” he wrote. “It was instant nerve relief. I haven’t felt this good in years.”\n\nHe vowed he would return to the PGA Tour.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Woods has sought professional help.\n\nHe was treated for sex addiction in 2009 after his wife, Elin Nordegren, and the entire world discovered he had been carrying on several extramarital affairs.\n\nWoods following his DUI arrest in May.\n\nWoods and Nordegren divorced in 2010, and his career hasn’t been the same since.\n\nWoods once seemed like a lock to surpass Jack Nicklaus’ record of 18 major championships. He raced to 14 major wins, but has been stuck there since he won the 2008 U.S. Open.\n\nBack problems have limited Woods to just 19 tournaments since 2014.\n\nWoods’ most recent surgery was in April, and he seemed upbeat about his recovery.\n\n“The surgery went well, and I’m optimistic this will relieve my back spasms and pain” Woods said. “When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long.”\n\nThe recovery period was supposed to be six months.\n\nIt’s unknown how long Woods will undergo treatment, and when he might return to golf.\n\n– With The Associated Press",

        "text": "On Tuesday’s The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the late-night host paid tribute to Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls organization by inviting the actress to compete against him in a game of “Are You Smarter Than a Smart Girl?”\n\nThe contest involved Fallon and Poehler each partnering up with a young girl to answer questions about math, science, geography and grammar.\n\nBefore the game got underway, Fallon’s partner Maya showed off her French rap skills, rapping a song from Hamilton, while Poehler’s partner Anaya displayed her talent for making purses out of duct tape.\n\nAs the competition began, Poehler started off by choosing math. She was asked, “If you have nine pizzas and then cut each pizza into eight slices, how many slices do you have?” Poehler confidently said, “73 slices,” before immediately doubting her answer.\n\n“No. No!” she said. Anaya whispered the correct answer of 72 to Poehler, who then said, “That’s what I meant [by] 73 — after I buy an extra slice.”\n\nFallon similarly struggled with his question, in which he had to determine the preposition in a sentence. Maya tried to shake her head to help him guess the correct answer, and while he eventually chose it, it took a lot of stalling on his part.\n\nThe game continued with coaxing from Anaya and Maya until the final question about the number of bones in a human body.

        "text": "Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSooner or later, most celebrities learn the rule: Never explain, never complain, especially not to supermarket tabloids.\n\nAriel Winter is young, only 19, so maybe she hasn't read the memo yet — thus, her Twitter tirade against Star magazine's story that claims the Modern Family star is the “breadwinner” in her relationship with actor Levi Meaden and that she actually pays him to \"take care of her.\"\n\nShe was outraged, she was incredulous, she was adamant. Not true and \"not cool,\" she said in a tweet that linked to a long rant.\n\n\"Star magazine is obviously a non-reputable source and a trash magazine, but seriously how dare you make up stuff that you have no idea about,\" she wrote.\n\nWinter has a personal assistant to take care of her, she said.\n\n\"I would NEVER pay my boyfriend any sort of allowance nor would he EVER accept it if I offered,\" she huffed. \"I HATE fake news but I guess that's what our world has come to.\"\n\nThe Star story isn't online, or at least not yet, but Gossip Cop, the website that devotes itself to debunking tabloid twaddle, reports that the \"ridiculous\" story by the \"repeatedly discredited\" tabloid quotes an anonymous source explaining that Meaden earns a wage to cook, clean and perform other household chores for Winter.\n\n“Some of Ariel’s friends worry that she’s throwing too much cash his way,” this supposed source says. “Why would he go on auditions when he can stay home and still collect a paycheck?”\n\nStar, Gossip Cop noted, is the same tabloid that once wrongly reported Winter was getting fired from Modern Family. She wasn't.\n\nWill Winter's scolding teach Star a lesson? Don't count on it.\n\nBut she's not the only celebrity who's gone off on Star recently. Winter's co-star Sofía Vergara got into a hissing match with the tabloid last month after it ran a cover story shouting that Vergara and husband Joe Manganiello, whose extravagant wedding took place in November 2015, were kaput.\n\nShe posted a scathing message on Instagram concluding with a hashtag: #Starmagazinebullies. \"The editor of this magazine is an idiot,\" she declared.",

        "text": "UPDATE: Despite Cosby’s own rep telling Rolling Stone and other media outlets that Bill Cosby‘s upcoming town halls would center around sexual assault, a second rep for the comedian has backtracked and said the meetings will focus on “restoration of [Cosby’s] legacy.”\n\n***\n\nLess than one week after a judge declared Bill Cosby’s sexual assault case a mistrial, the embattled actor-comedian is gearing up to “get back to work.”\n\nOn Thursday, Cosby’s rep, Andrew Wyatt, told Good Day Alabama host Janice Rogers that the actor is planning to hold a series of town hall meetings starting “sometime in July” to help educate young men and women about sexual violence – specifically, the threat of being accused of inappropriate behavior.\n\n“This is bigger than Bill Cosby,” Wyatt said on the show. “This issue can affect any young person, especially young athletes, of today, and they need to know what they’re facing when they’re hanging out and partying, when they’re doing certain things they shouldn’t be doing. And it also affects married men.”\n\nWyatt’s reference to married men is a nod to the primary argument made by Cosby’s defense attorney Brian McMonagle, that Cosby was a man who had been unfaithful to his wife, but not a perpetrator of sexual assault, as accuser Andrea Constand had testified. Added Ebonee Benson, a spokeswoman for Camille Cosby, “Laws are changing, the statute of limitations for victims of sexual assault are being extended, so this is why people need to be educated on … a brush against the shoulder. Anything at this point can be considered sexual assault. It’s a good thing to be educated about the laws.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, Wyatt issued a statement to Rolling Stone confirming the town halls – and suggesting that he’s hoping they will expose the larger forces at play in Cosby’s trial.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\n“My Associate Ebonee Benson and I received hundreds of calls from civic organizations and churches requesting for Mr. Cosby to speak to young men and women about the judicial system,” Wyatt tells Rolling Stone. “They feel that the young men and women need to be aware that Mr. Cosby was given a deal to never be criminally charged by Former DA Bruce Castor and 12 years later DA Kevin Steele runs a Willie Horton style campaign ad saying, ‘If you elect me I will bring Bill Cosby to justice.'”\n\n“These groups would like for Mr. Cosby to share that people in the judicial system can use their powers to annul deals for personal agenda and political ambitions,” he adds. “Speeches will be free.”\n\n“People can educate themselves on the situation that they’re facing today,” Wyatt tells Rolling Stone of the planned events. “Laws are changing. Statute of limitations are being amended. It’s important to educate people that you could be at a baseball game and it could be crowded and a young man could try to squeeze through and accidentally touch a young lady’s butt or breast by mistake and that could be considered sexual assault. It’s imperative that we educate people that want to be educated.”\n\nFollowing the mistrial ruling, Steele announced he would retry Cosby within 120 days. While Wyatt admits that “our legal team will be going through everything he’s going to say,” he claims his team will not vet audience questions ahead of time, ostensibly allowing both supporters and detractors from questioning the comedian. “I don’t think he’s going to say anything to jeopardize the [upcoming] trial or put himself in harm’s way,” Wyatt says. “There are going to be some questions he won’t be able to answer.”\n\nThe genesis of the planned town halls, says Wyatt, came from requests from various church and civic organizations, though he declined to provide any specific groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, an anonymous juror told ABC News that the jury was deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberation because of two jurors who believed Cosby should be acquitted. “There was no budging,” after the first deadlock, the juror said, “and there was none from there on out.”\n\nA second juror spoke to The Associated Press Thursday, saying that the jury was actually more evenly split with a similar number of jurors wanting to convict Cosby as wanted to acquit him.\n\nThe second juror told the AP it was suspicious that the three charges of sexual misconduct were brought about, though “no new evidence from ’05 to now has showed up, no stained clothing, no smoking gun, nothing.” They added that other jurors similarly expressed the view that “politics was involved.”\n\nTrending Trump Demands MAGA Group Give Him ‘Millions.’ That’s Not Legal, Experts Say Cher Files for Conservatorship of Son Elijah Blue Allman, Citing 'Severe' Substance Abuse Watch Miley Cyrus Cover Journey's Hit '80s Anthem 'Faithfully' Who Is Gypsy Rose Blanchard?\n\nWith any public event for a figure as polarizing as Cosby, the actor risks facing highly visible protests and scrutiny. “People have a right to protest,” says Wyatt. “We just ask that our supporters be respectful and not engage or incite anything … He has been consistent that people respect each other. He has used his entire career to humanize all age groups, races, genders and religious groups and he’ll continue to do that as he moves on with his life.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Jason Newman\n\nWatch everything we know about the Bill Cosby sexual assault trial.",

        "text": "Mariah Carey, making a mess of things with diva behavior? As improbable as it seems, “The House” actor Cedric Yarbrough says that it really happened.\n\nYarbrough took to Facebook on Wednesday to detail how the singer “ruined” an intended cameo featuring her in the film.\n\n“Yeah, a real funny cameo was SUPPOSED to happen in the new film #TheHouse with the superstar Mariah Carey. But it was ruined by superstar Mariah Carey,” Yarbrough wrote. “The film takes place in a suburban home but is made into a ‘Casino’. Why not have Mariah be an act in the casino? Funny idea.”\n\nYarbrough went on to say that Carey “eventually” graced the set with her presence, “after waiting for her for 3-4 hours!” And when the porpoise-ranged songstress arrived, Yarbrough recalled, she scuttled a stunt that had been cooked up in her absence.\n\n“While we waited the director & team had the idea of doing a stunt that Mariah’s body double would do now & bring in Mariah to match it. They do the stunt. All goes well,” Yarbrough wrote. “When Mariah finally showed up she refused to match the stunt. ‘Darling, I would never do it that way…’”\n\nYarbrough added that Carey “requested a large fan for her hair to be blown around and a camera that would be above her, basically a crane shot.”\n\nThe actor went on to call Carey “borderline abusive.”\n\n“This lady was unprofessional & borderline abusive to our director, who tried his best to appease her every wish. In the acting community, it’s not very good form to ‘tell’ on your fellow actors,” Yarbrough added. “They could be having a bad day, going through some personal things, & maybe Mariah was, I don’t know. But I do know that our crew didn’t deserve that, our director didn’t.”\n\nAs unsettling as Yarbrough’s account was, the actor wrote that he hadn’t even divulged the worst of it.\n\n“This kind of behavior just isn’t cool. I’m not even going to tell you the worst part. (i will if i see you in person & if i deem you ‘cool’),” Yarbrough wrote. “For you young actors, be on time, know your homework, but be courteous and respectful. For us old heads, the same. This kind of behavior should be called out for what it is. I miss ‘I had a vision of love’ Mariah. Be a damn professional.”",

The feeling is I don't even necessarily get the strongest impression of someone seeking someone out, like, 'I'm going to take your life.' There's a feeling of something goes wrong, and I don't know why this feeling of something goes wrong, like that wasn't the original plan.\"\n\nThe medium adds that the feeling comes across more as a robbery than it does as an intended murder.\n\n\"I'm sure you're referring to my fiancé who was murdered,\" Nancy responds solemnly. \"We think for...as a mugging. I'm not really sure why. I've never known.\"\n\nGrace explains that her fiancé had gotten a summer job on a construction site and just happened to be \"at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\n\"A guy that had been fired from the job came back with a gun and he unloaded the whole gun on Keith — around his face, neck and back. And that's what happened. It was not an argument. They didn't really know each other at all, but he was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\n\"I don't know what the guy intended,\" she added. \"I'm sure it wasn't to go murder Keith because he didn't really know Keith, but he did murder Keith.\"\n\nGrace, now 57, was only 20 years old when she lost Keith.",

All roads leading to the area of the fire were closed.\n\n“My heart goes out to all in the area who are also experiencing loss from this vicious fire, the threat of which we live with constantly, which may seem crazy to some but we do so because living in our beautiful, rural area makes it worthwhile,” he said in a statement to TMZ (which first reported the news).\n\n“It’s never the structures that create a community — it’s the people. And if the people of Santa Margarita have taught me anything it’s that, once the smoke has cleared, literally and figuratively, it’s a time to reach out and rebuild,” he continued.\n\n“We’ve done it before, and will need to do it together again, and it will make our community even closer and stronger,” the statement concluded. “Endless thanks to CalFire and the Sheriff’s Office. I know you guys are fighting the good fight to keep us safe. So very relieved no one has been hurt.”",

It wasn't an indication of some sort of subconscious reflection of the status of our relationship.\"\n\nTom and Katie officially tied the knot in a rustic-chic wedding in front of family, friends, and the whole Vanderpump Rules crew at Twenty Mile House in Northern California on August 17, 2016. Vanderpump Rules fans witnessed the lovely nuptials last season.\n\nTom and Katie previously addressed those who doubt the longevity of their relationship on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen last December. \"I expected people to say that,\" Katie said. \"I've been seeing all kinds of nonsense. We know when we wake up every day with each other, we're gonna be on our rocking chairs being like, 'Remember when all those people didn't believe in us?' We really are in it for the long haul.\"\n\nRelive the magic of Tom and Katie's wedding, below.",

It will air in 2018, as announced through a letter from creator Lana Wachowski on the show’s Facebook page.\n\nThe news is particularly unexpected given that Netflix previously posted a response to the multitude of fan campaigns a week after the cancelation apologetically stating, “We've thought long and hard here at Netflix to try to make it work but unfortunately we can't.” The show was praised for its incredibly diverse cast of characters, but the multiple-location conceit meant that Sense8 was also one of the most expensive shows on television: some estimates were putting it at $9 million per episode, which may have contributed to the cancelation.",

However, he clarified with an interview on Today that it’s not the case.\n\n“They made so much of a big deal out of this,” he explained. “I got asked in an interview if I read negative things and I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t even go on Twitter anymore.’ It’s not like I quit it. I still post on Instagram and post on Twitter.”\n\nHe continued, “I’m just not going to wake up and read something and be like, ‘Well, that’s rude.’ I don’t want to choose to do that anymore, and everyone’s made a huge deal out of it.”\n\nHost Matt Lauer said he likely had plenty of good tweets to read thanks to his fans who were outside ready to watch him perform.\n\n“There’s so much positivity out there,” Sheeran replied. “I’m just saying as a human being, we always read the one negative one and ignore the others, and I don’t want to do that. It’s just foolish to do when there’s love out there in the world to look at the negative stuff. I’m just choosing not to read it.”\n\nSheeran told The Sun that he still finds that a troll can bring him down.\n\n“One comment ruins your day,” he shared. “The head f— for me has been trying to work out why people dislike me so much.”\n\nFROM PEN: If You Had To Google For ‘Ibiza’ After The Grammys, You’re Not Alone\n\nLady Gaga came out in support of Sheeran after he mentioned that her fans sometimes assumed he was speaking about her during interviews.\n\n“What an incredible talented artist I LOVE ED,” she wrote. “@teddysphotos deserves all our love and respect like all humans do. I wish all people on the internet would be positive and loving and a part of creating an online community that is kind and empowering, not hateful and mean. No reason to tear down an artist simply because they are on top. Work harder to be kinder everybody. That should be your first duty to humanity.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Sheeran clarified his remarks on Instagram: “…loads of Hoo-har about me quitting stuff. I haven’t quit anything, I’m just not reading anything, except Harry Potter. Hope everyone had a wonderful July 4th yo.”\n\nFresh from headlining Sunday night at the Glastonbury Festival, Sheeran is back on the road as part of his North American tour to support his latest album, ÷.",

Until then, all parties are restrained from gathering additional evidence.\n\nWilliams faces a lawsuit from the family of Barson, 78, who died from injuries sustained in the crash on June 9 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.\n\nAccording to the police collision report obtained by ABC News, Williams was \"at fault for violating the right of way of [the other driver].\"\n\nJerome Barson's wife, Linda Barson, was driving the vehicle, a Hyundai Accent, when it hit Williams' Toyota Sequoia. He was taken to a local hospital and died from his injuries two weeks later.\n\nWhile discussing her first-round victory at Wimbledon on Monday, Williams broke down after reporters asked a question about the crash.\n\n\"There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and — yeah, I'm completely speechless,\" she said, as she held back tears in the tournament's media room.\n\n\"Maybe I should go,\" she said before a tournament representative told her it was OK to leave. She returned later and answered a few more questions.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the Barsons' daughter, alleges wrongful death action, and the family is seeking damages in excess of $15,000, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by ABC News.\n\nAfter the collision and Barson's death, Malcolm Cunningham, an attorney for Williams, noted in a statement to ABC News that authorities did not issue her any citations and that \"Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one.\"\n\nPolice are still investigating the crash.",

In March, Swift broke her social media silence to promote Lorde’s new single, and in November, threw her a star-studded 20th birthday bash at Carbone in New York City.\n\nFROM COINAGE: If You Had To Google For ‘Ibiza’ After The Grammys, You’re Not Alone\n\nFellow celebs who turned out included Aziz Ansari, Lena Dunham,Tavi Gevinson, Jack Antonoff, Mae Whitman, and model Karlie Kloss.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BMioGS4FKwr/\n\nLorde received backlash last month when she compared her friendship with Swift to a disease during an interview with the Guardian, trying to express the challenges of staying close with someone so famous.\n\n“It’s like having a friend with very specific allergies. There are certain places you can’t go together; certain things you can’t do,” she said. “There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship — it’s like having a friend with an autoimmune disease.”\n\nLorde eventually apologized for the comment on Twitter, writing that she “f—– up & it was really insensitive.”\n\nAttention to Swift’s so-called “squad” mostly began in 2015 after the release of her star-studded “Bad Blood” music video, which featured Selena Gomez, Zendaya, Lena Dunham and Gigi Hadid, among others.",

Chyna addressed the video in an interview with Good Morning America on Monday, saying that she sent it to Kardashian in hopes that it would convince him to leave her alone. Bustle has reached out to reps for Kardashian and Chyna regarding the allegations made against each other, but did not receive a response. Kardashian's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, told TMZ that Kardashian's rant was \"a spontaneous reaction that he regrets.\"\n\nThe nude photos that Kardashian posted of Chyna were the main subject of the GMA segment. In the state of California, where both stars reside, posting sexually explicit photos that were understood to be meant to remain private without permission constitutes revenge porn and is punishable by law. Chyna intends to file a restraining order against Kardashian on Monday.\n\nIn addition to the potential illegality of the photos posted, the conversation also turned to the allegations that Kardashian made in his Instagram posts. In the series of since-deleted posts, he accused his ex of cheating on him, exploiting him for money, and abusing drugs and alcohol. Chyna responded with her own allegation, claiming on Snapchat that Kardashian was physically abusive, a charge which she reiterated in the GMA interview.\n\nChyna defended her decision to send the video of herself with another man to her ex. She clamed that Kardashian wouldn’t leave her alone, and said the video was meant to establish boundaries. \"I've been broken up with Rob since December and it's like, if somebody keeps poking at you and poking at you and poking at you, and keep poking at you, you're eventually, you're gonna pop,\" Chyna told GMA. \"And so I was just like, 'Maybe if I send this video to him, then he'll just leave me alone.'\"\n\nThe interviewer questioned whether there was any truth to her ex’s accusations that the couple were still together at the time the video was sent, which Chyna denied. She also refused the allegations that she used Kardashian family name for fame. “I was already Blac Chyna before the Kardashians,” the reality star responded. She also said that she her love for Kardashian was genuine when they were together. “Nobody was out to make a baby out of spite.”\n\nKardashian’s actions were, to Chyna, a violation of her trust. \"I was devastated, of course. I'm like, 'How could somebody, like, post these pictures of me?,'” Chyna told GMA. \"And I'm like, wow, OK, like, this is a person that I trusted. I just felt betrayed.\"\n\nShe also refuted claims that she had liked some of the pictures on Instagram, claiming that she had Kardashian's account blocked. Chyna hopes that pressing charges will inspire more women to come forward if they are ever in a similar situation. “It's just not right, it's not fair, and I feel like women should take up for themselves,\" Chyna said. \"I would like to just say something to all the women out there. You know, you're not the only one that's probably going through something. So I feel as though if one person speaks up, maybe it, hopefully, it will be a domino effect.”\n\nKardashian and Chyna's lawyers are expected in court Monday. According to TMZ, Kardashian will reportedly agree to Chyna's request for a restraining order.",

        "text": "Harry Styles' fame primarily comes from his time with One Direction, but in addition to now setting off on a solo career, the singer is also branching out elsewhere to express himself creatively. This summer he'll appear in Dunkirk, which will mark his acting debut, but Styles couldn't just go into Christopher Nolan's next movie without going through a major life change. To fit into the movie's World War II setting, he had to chop off those dreamy locks of his, and as one would expect after a haircut of that magnitude, Styles felt very weird afterwards. As he put it:\n\nI felt very naked. When I first told my parents I was going to be in a World War II film, they thought that I was playing a lady on the train station waving the soldiers off, so we had to make the chop. But it was good! It's very breezy.\n\nWhile promoting his new sing \"The Sign of the Times\" on Elvis Duran and the Morning Show, Harry Styles talked a little bit about Dunkirk, including what cutting off his hair for the movie felt like. When you've had long hair for as long as Styles did, surely that feeling of nakedness sounds about right. Still, a hairdo like that wouldn't go over well if he truly was enlisted during World War II, so it had to go! Fortunately for Styles, he enjoyed the breezy feeling afterwards, so it wasn't all bad. Whether or not he ever goes back to such a short length again willingly remains to be seen, though if Styles intends to keep acting, he'll need to get used to making certain changes with his appearance for roles.\n\nChristopher Nolan's Dunkirk will tell the real-life story of the Dunkirk evacuation, which took place in 1940 (only one year after World War II began) and saw Allied soldiers from Great Britain, Belgium, Canada and France being surrounded by German forces from the beaches of the eponymous location. Besides Harry Styles, the main cast includes Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, James D'Arcy, Jack Lowden and Fionn Whitehead.\n\nCheck out the Dunkirk trailer below to catch a glimpse of Harry Styles and his other costars in full military/period attire.\n\nYou can see Harry Styles jump into the world of acting when Dunkirk is released on July 21, though theaters with physical film projectors have the option of screening it two days earlier.

By July 2017, ET learned she was dating Antin.\n\n\"I think everyone always wants there to be someone at fault, or a reason why, or someone wants to point the finger, and I think because I started dating Devin so soon after, I was kind of an easy target,\" Bushnell expressed. \"That was obviously hard, but breakups are hard, whether you met on The Bachelor or not. Breakups suck.\"\n\nThe former reality star said she wanted to take her time in her relationship with Antin and not rush into moving in together. But she did praise him for pushing her to go after new projects.\n\n\"He really does push me to do things that I've dreamt of or I'm passionate about or want to do, and not push me in a way that's like, aggressive,\" she told ET. \"[He] gives me that little nudge that maybe I need at times, which is really cool, and I've never really had someone who does that for me.\"\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

The conversation came to a head last week when two young girls were told they would not be able to board a United Airlines flight because they were wearing leggings. And the issue of whether or not to wear sneakers, though not likely to set off a viral news story, still tends to polarize. Leave it to frequent flyer Miranda Kerr, though, to override the debate with a look that combined the comfort of a legging and the elegance of a heel in one fell swoop.\n\nKerr touched down at Los Angeles International airport today in a tonal look that started from the ground up. She wore stirrup spandex boots by Balenciaga, a legging-like silhouette that extends from hip to toe for a smooth, seamless finish. The effect was a stylish step up from the stretchy sportswear that we’re used to seeing at the airport—and everywhere else, for that matter.\n\nKerr tucked a slim navy top into an Alaïa miniskirt in the same shade. While a pencil skirt would have been impractical for travel, her fit-and-flare silhouette offered a more movement-friendly alternative that felt just as feminine. Plus, the laser-cut detail on the hem tied in with the floral embroidery covering the Samantha Thavasa shoulder bag swinging at her side. Kerr threw on a tailored overcoat in for good measure, because you never know when those cabin temperatures might take a dip.",

In L'Engle's book, Meg Murray is a white teenager from Connecticut; in the film she's an African-American girl from South Central L.A. who comes from an interracial family. The latter is “never commented on, which I think is great,” says a bearded Chris Pine, who plays Meg’s astrophysicist father.\n\nThe director also shifted away from the all-white Mrs. characters in L'Engle's book, instead assembling Winfrey, Kaling and Witherspoon as Meg's galactic guides. “I just started to think about really wanting to represent different kinds, cultures, sizes, ages of women,” DuVernay says.\n\nWhen Winfrey read the script by Frozen's Jennifer Lee, she was taken with \"Ava’s idea for inclusion, diversifying, opening it up so that the Mrs. are not all like Mrs. Doubtfire, little New England biddies, but this eclectic group of star angels who have their own way of being in the world. That was really kind of thrilling to me.\"\n\nKaling, DuVernay adds, “is a piece of the puzzle that is so important, because when we talk about inclusion in this country we say black and white, and we forget all the other people. The three of them together are quite formidable in what they represent for women at large.”\n\nToday, a Girl Scout cookie drive adds an earthly touch on a soundstage cloaked in massive, saturated blue sheets, onto which the computer-generated world of Wrinkle will be overlaid. (DuVernay tosses a box of cookies to Reid once the scene wraps.)\n\nCameras roll, and Reid pretends to struggle to breathe as Winfrey and cast stand in position on sheets of glass made to look like an iceberg.\n\nDuVerney squints at the screen.\n\n“You’ve got fingerprints I can see all around her,” she says. “It’s supposed to be ice.” A female production assistant runs in, wiping the surface down. The director, dressed in jeans and a black sweatshirt, joins in on hands and knees, pointing out prints to wipe.\n\nMore:Oprah wears the most amazing outfits in 'Wrinkle in Time' trailer\n\nAlso:10 must-see films of 2018, from the new 'Fantastic Beasts' to 'Mary Poppins'\n\nDuVernay stays on the floor with Reid, softly talking to the young actress, who is playing her first major role. “All right?” she says. The teen nods. “Let’s get another (take),\" says the director.\n\nOnce they wrap, Winfrey regally ambles by in her metallic blue lipstick, a blond curly wig and a massive geometric skirt. Today is the second day Pine has worked alongside the mogul. “It’s so cool, man,” he says. “We talked books together the other day,\" trading recommendations. (His was Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See.)\n\nEmbodying Mrs. Which is no joke: It takes two aides to hold Winfrey up as she inches in platform heels toward her tent. “It is a THING,” she says a few minutes later of her getup, while leaning precariously on a stool. “Two people have to help me sit. Three people help me get dressed. Or was it four this morning?”\n\nAt night, she says, \"it takes me at least a half-hour just to get (Mrs. Which's makeup) off. See, my own eyebrows are covered, they’re glued down. Those makeup removal pads, I use like 10 of those first, then a makeup remover thing, and then you start the whole washing process.\"\n\nGet down to brass tacks, and Winfrey acknowledges she didn’t expect to be here. “I never planned on being in A Wrinkle in Time. It came about because Ava said (the movie was) going to be shooting in New Zealand,\" where production moves the following week. \"I always wanted to go to New Zealand!”\n\nMore:10 major milestones for women behind the camera in Hollywood\n\nEarlier:Reese Witherspoon: 'I have 3 legs'; Oprah Winfrey: 'I know you accept my 3d hand'\n\nSo much so that Winfrey blocked out Wrinkle’s shooting dates on her calendar to hang out and be a spectator. It was only then that DuVernay, who generally avoids asking Winfrey for favors, asked her to read the script. Winfrey fell for Mrs. Which, a character she calls sort of a Glinda the Good Witch imbued with the wisdom of Maya Angelou.\n\nAnd now, she’s stuck. Literally.\n\n“I can’t move my arms. Oh, I’m caught,” Winfrey sighs. “This happens all day long.”\n\nWhat does Winfrey do when she goes home after a day on set in full hair and makeup?\n\n\"I will open the refrigerator in my hotel and get a bad glass of wine. You know, the kind with the cap on it.\" She laughs. \"And take a hot bath and (the next day) start all over again.\"",

        "text": "Aaron Carter is speaking out about his DUI arrest over the weekend – lashing out at police and even his brother Nick.\n\nThe former child star, 29, was pulled over about 9 p.m. Saturday in Habersham County, Georgia, about 90 miles north of Atlanta. He was charged with driving under the influence, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana and possession of drug-related objects.\n\nHis girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the car with him and was also arrested, PEOPLE confirms. She was charged with possession of marijuana, obstruction of law enforcement officers and possession of drug-related objects, according to the sheriff’s office.\n\nBackstreet Boy Nick Carter shared a message to his younger brother on Twitter following news of the incident.\n\n“To my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better,” Nick, 37, wrote. “Family isn’t always easy, [but] we’re all here for you.”\n\nAaron Carter. Habersham County Sheriff's Office via AP\n\nIn a public statement posted on Twitter Sunday night, Aaron made it clear that he didn’t think his brother went about the situation in the right away.\n\n“If my own blood truly cared about my well-being, why wouldn’t he call me directly and have a conversation instead of making this about him through a very public forum?” he said in the statement. “That’s not cool at all to use me for his PR and kick me while I am down. I love my family despite it through thick and thin.”\n\nNick seemingly responded to the message by retweeting a post by Nick’s wife, Lauren, which read, “Hey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again!”\n\nAaron’s rep Jonathan Ward tells PEOPLE the popstar is reachable by his family — “whom he loves” — at any time.\n\n“Nick and Lauren have his number – it hasn’t changed. They last spoke on July 6,” Ward tells PEOPLE exclusively. “He doesn’t feel it was proper, what happened. You don’t reach out through Twitter.”\n\nAaron Carter also professed his innocence of all charges – and claimed he was targeted by police because he was famous.\n\nAccording to the statement, Carter said he was at an AutoZone in Georgia to fix a tire that was out of alignment on his car when police officers arrested him “with aggression.”\n\nHe added that he has a license for medical marijuana for his anxiety and feels he was marked due to his fame.\n\n“He feels his ‘celebrity’ was targeted and an attorney will be retained in this matter,” the statement said. “The video from AutoZone will prove that Aaron was not in a moving vehicle while arrested and charged with a DUI.”\n\nMedical marijuana is legal in Georgia with a license. However, anxiety is not one of the 14 specific conditions covered.\n\nMadison Parker and Aaron Carter. Allen Berezovsky/Getty Image\n\nThe singer was previously arrested for investigation of marijuana possession in 2008.\n\nCarter has previously said he “smokes bud,” but denied drinking or doing any other drugs.\n\nDuring a candid interview for an episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? last year, Aaron admitted that he turned to drugs and alcohol to self-medicate for depression he experienced after his parents’ divorce and his time on Dancing with the Stars.\n\n“I started getting really heavy into drinking and was telling people, ‘I’m on a real bad path right now. I need help,’ ” he explained.\n\nIn 2011, Aaron checked himself into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California “to heal some emotional and spiritual issues he was dealing with,” his manager at the time, Johnny Wright, previously said in a statement.\n\nAaron has been in the spotlight since recording his first album at age seven. He was just 12 when his song “Aaron’s Party (Come Get It)” dropped. It went triple platinum and made him an international sensation.",

        "text": "Just a few weeks ago, Bachelor in Paradise wasn't a sure thing that was happening this summer, but now it's officially coming back on August 14. But the first footage of the show fans got to see wasn't exactly what most people expected. On Monday night, the Bachelor in Paradise Season 4 trailer dropped and a lot of fans felt that it seemed kind of inappropriate after everything that's happened surrounding the show. (ABC declined to comment on the promo.)\n\nInstead of showing a few scenes that would give fans something to look forward to in the month left before the premiere like most first promos do, this one had a bit of a different tone. It first played up how upset some fans were when they found out that Bachelor in Paradise production was put on hold last month following a producer complaint about the relationship between Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson. Then the preview showed how some fans celebrated when news broke that the show actually was coming back, after all.\n\nAt the time of the production shut down, Warner Brothers, the production company for the show, stated: \"We have become aware of allegations of misconduct on the set of Bachelor in Paradise in Mexico. We have suspended production and we are conducting a thorough investigation of these allegations. Once the investigation is complete, we will take appropriate responsive action.\" The investigation was later concluded with no evidence of wrongdoing. A Warner Bros. spokesperson gave this statement to Bustle about production resuming.\n\nOur internal investigation, conducted with the assistance of an outside law firm, has now been completed. Out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved, we do not intend to release the videotape of the incident. We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any cast member was ever in jeopardy. Production on this season of Bachelor in Paradise will be resuming, and we plan to implement certain changes to the show’s policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.”\n\nBut even though many fans were happy when they found out that BiP was coming back after all, it seemed wrong to many fans to promote the season this way — after all, what happened involved real people and affected their real lives.\n\nEven though the investigation launched by Warner Brothers came up with no evidence of wrongdoing, Corinne and DeMario have both been open about how the situation affected their lives outside of BiP in interviews they've done since. And beyond Corinne and DeMario, there was an entire cast of people (plus the show's crew) who were affected by the show's brief suspension of production. Making light of the situation wasn't really the best way the show could have chosen to handle or move past what happened. In fact, the trailer didn't even need to address it — that could have been saved for the premiere — but the way that it did was uncomfortable for many to watch.\n\nThe trailer talked more about the fact that the show was cancelled and then revived than what's going to happen in the season to come. There were a few quick clips and soundbites from contestants, but it paled in comparison to the amount of time spent on showing tweets from fans on the screen.\n\nThere are many fans who are excited to watch BiP in August. But celebrating it so blatantly when real people's lives were involved? That didn't really seem to sit well with many viewers.",

        "text": "Does Blac Chyna have a bun in the oven?! The 29-year-old star has been making headlines as she and her much younger boyfriend, 18-year-old rapper YBN Almighty Jay, continue to step out together, but according to a new report by MTO News that was further confirmed by Page Six on April 30, Chyna is nearly three months pregnant with his baby.\n\nChyna sparked the pregnancy rumors when she and Jay were spotted at LAX on April 28, where fans thought she was sporting a bit of a bump, which she tried to cover up with a baggy sweatshirt. According to the report, Chyna flashed a smile at the paparazzi and even rubbed her stomach. In a recent interview, Jay admitted he wasn't wearing condoms, and that he wouldn't mind if Chyna got pregnant. \"I don’t wear condoms,\" he said. \"I would not want to f–k a bitch I did not want to get pregnant. If Chyna got pregnant, I would keep that s–t like ‘ohh daddy love you,’ I love that ass.’\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BgmfJ1Jlvs4/\n\nIf the news is true, it would be the pair's first child together, though Chyna is already a mom of two. She shares 16-month-old daughter Dream with her ex Rob Kardashian, and she also shares a five-year-old son named King with her ex, Tyga. Even though it seems like Chyna really enjoys motherhood, her co-parenting relationship with her exes aren't going as smooth. Rob and Chy may start battling it out soon for custody of Dream after Chyna was involved in a violent incident at an amusement park earlier this month. TMZ also stated that Rob doesn't want Chyna introducing Dream to all of the men that she dates unless she becomes involved in a long-term romance.\n\nChyna and Jay may have only been dating since February, but things seemed to have turned serious quickly. Just a few weeks ago, Jay posted an Instagram of Chyna with the caption, \"Will You Marry Me?\" It looks like Jay was just professing his love for his girlfriend, as Chyna hasn't been seen wearing a ring, and she's been staying silent on both the engagement and pregnancy rumors — though the speculation is only growing, as fans have started posting comments on her Instagram claiming that they see a baby bump.\n\nOn one of her most recent photos, one fan wrote, \"I love the outfit, but… Chyna looks pregnant in this picture… I see her glow… I tried to hold it in and I can't,\" while another simply exclaimed, \"I see a bump!!! Congratulations!!\" It looks like we'll have to keep our eyes peeled to see whether or not Chyna really is expecting another little one.",

The singer proposed to Hailey Baldwin after only a few weeks of dating (but close to a decade of friendship) during a special island engagement moon, and the model is now wearing not one but two rings on her left hand.\n\nIn photos circulating social media, Baldwin is seen wearing a huge oval diamond engagement ring set on what looks to be a rose gold pavé diamond band. A second solo wedding-like band is seen on top of the diamond.\n\n“Justin is of course ahead of the trends, selecting an oval stone for Hailey’s ring, which has been somewhat rare over the past decade but is making a huge resurgence,” Andrew Brown, President of WP Diamonds tells PEOPLE. “Hailey’s oval stone is about six carats, F-G color grade and VS clarity, making it one of the better diamonds out there. Set in an elegant rose gold pavé band, the retail on this stone would be around $400,000.”\n\nAnd while Baldwin is wearing what looks like a wedding band, a source tells PEOPLE this trip was all about an engagement.\n\n“Justin picked out the ring before they flew to the Bahamas,” a source close to the Canadian superstar, 24, told PEOPLE exclusively. “He took Hailey on a special trip to propose. She didn’t know.”\n\nBieber was “nervous but excited,” ahead of the proposal, adds the source. “He is super happy that she said, ‘Yes.'”\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin Hit Washington State for Church and a Hot Tub Session\n\nThe large oval diamond looks very similar to Blake Lively’s engagement ring from Ryan Reynolds, designed by Lorraine Schwartz. Baldwin, 21, often turns to the Schwartz with help accessorizing her red carpet looks, but a rep for the brand confirmed to PEOPLE that the jeweler is not behind the ring.\n\nSplash News\n\nOn Sunday, PEOPLE confirmed that the Drop the Mic co-host and the singer are engaged.\n\n“It’s kind of a surprise, but kind of not. Justin has been extremely happy these past few weeks,” an insider said of Bieber’s proposal. “He has known Hailey for a long time. This might seem sudden, but they know each other very well.”",

        "text": "Brad Pitt is making matcha green tea on a cool morning in his old Craftsman in the Hollywood Hills, where he's lived since 1994. There have been other properties in other places—including a château in France and homes in New Orleans and New York City—but this has always been his kids' “childhood home,” he says. And even though they're not here now, he's decided it's important that he is. Today the place is deeply silent, except for the snoring of his bulldog, Jacques.\n\nPitt wears a flannel shirt and skinny jeans that hang loose on his frame. Invisible to the eye is that sculpted bulk we've seen on film for a quarter-century. He looks like an L.A. dad on a juice cleanse, gearing up to do house projects. On the counter sit some plated goodies from Starbucks, which he doesn't touch, and some coffee, which he does. Pitt, who exudes likability, general decency, and a sense of humor (dark and a little cockeyed), says he's really gotten into making matcha lately, something a friend introduced him to. He loves the whole ritual of it. He deliberately sprinkles some green powder in a cup with a sifter, then pours in the boiling water, whisking with a bamboo brush, until the liquid is a harlequin froth. “You're gonna love this,” he says, handing me the cup.\n\nGet the summer issue of GQ Style on newsstands soon, or subscribe here.\n\nSerenity, balance, order: That's the vibe, at least. That's what you think you're feeling in the kitchen of Brad Pitt's perfectly constructed, awesomely decorated abode. Outside, children's bikes are lined up in the rack; a blown-up dragon floatie bobs on the pool through the window. From the sideboard, with its exquisite inlay, to the vase on the mantel, the house exudes care and intention. And it carries its own stories, not just about when the Jolie-Pitts were a happy family, but also from back in the day, when Jimi Hendrix crashed here. It's said he wrote “May This Be Love” out in the grotto, with its waterfall (Waterfall / Nothing can harm me at all…). “I don't know if it's true,” says Pitt, “but a hippie came by and said he used to drop acid with Jim back there, so I run with the story.”\n\nAnd yet Pitt is the first one to acknowledge that it's been chaos these past six months, during what he calls a “weird” time. In conversation, he seems absolutely locked in one moment and a little twitchy and forlorn in the next, having been put on a journey he didn't intend to make but admits was “self-inflicted.” The unfortunate worst of it surfaced in public this past September. When he was on a flight to Los Angeles aboard a private plane, there was a reported altercation between Pitt and one of his six children, 15-year-old Maddox. An anonymous phone call was made to the authorities, which triggered an FBI investigation (ultimately closed with no charges). Five days later, his wife, Angelina Jolie, filed for divorce. By then, everything in Pitt's world was in free fall. It wasn't just a public-relations crisis—there was a father suddenly deprived of his kids, a husband without wife. And here he is, alone, a 53-year-old human father/former husband smack in the middle of an unraveled life, figuring out how to mend it back together.",

        "text": "Khloé Kardashian has forgiven Tristan Thompson after his shocking cheating scandal, but she’s not exactly ready to play house with her baby daddy just yet. Even though the reality star and NBA baller have officially returned to Los Angeles with their precious daughter, Tristan feels “dumped” since she’s not letting him move in with them. “She still wants him in her life, and she wants True to have a father,” a source tells In Touch exclusively. “He may not be the best boyfriend, but he’s a good father.”\n\n“She’d been planning to ask him to move in when she returned home from Cleveland with True,” our source explained. “But then the cheating scandal happened, and she had to rethink everything. There obviously are trust issues now. But Khloé still hasn’t kicked him to the curb. She found it in her heart to forgive him. She just doesn’t think it’s the right time for them to be moving in together.”\n\nIt looks like Khloé is trying to put the drama behind her once and for all, as she was spotted out with the Cavaliers star on June 18. The new parents stopped by the celebrity hotspot Nobu before making their way to The Peppermint Club. Khloé appears to be putting on a brave face after welcoming baby True in April, days after the cheating scandal came to light. As they work on their relationship issues, Khloé will stay at her house while Tristan will reside nearby at his Los Angeles-based home.\n\nKhloé has faced no shortage of drama after Tristan’s infidelities. A video surfaced in April of her baby daddy kissing one woman while being groped by another in Washington, D.C., while Khloé was reportedly three months pregnant. Making matters even worse, Tristan was also spotted making out with Instagram model Lani Blair at an NYC nightclub days before Khloé gave birth to their first child together. Time will tell if they can work through their differences!\n\nRead more about Khloé and Tristan in the latest issue of In Touch on newsstands now!",

Friends say neither of them wanted to waste more time apart.” While visiting Bloom in Prague — where he’s currently filming his upcoming Amazon series, Carnival Row — the mag’s source says Perry and the actor enjoyed a romantic lunch on February 28, where they cozied up together at Cafe Savoy.\n\nAs you may know, Perry and Bloom have both been married in the past. Perry wed actor Russell Brand, 42, in October 2010, and later divorced him in July 2012. Bloom wed model Miranda Kerr, 34, in July 2010. The two — who share a son, Flynn, 7, together — divorced in July 2013. However, all hope for lifelong love isn’t lost for Perry and Bloom, the insider says, adding that “Katy is a romanic at heart.” — “Her first wedding [to Brand], was a spectacle, then the marriage went down in flames… They’ve [Perry and Bloom] both always said if they did it again, they’d want it to be quiet and intimate.” And, according to the mag, they accomplished just that.\n\nRumors that Katy and Orlando had rekindled their romance began to spread in early January 2018, when they were together on holiday in the Maldives; A vacation that the mag claims the two “officially” rekindled their romance on. Before that, the two were spotted at an Ed Sheeran concert in LA back in August 2017. The on-again, off-again lovers have also been teasing a reconciliation by flirting on social media, liking one another’s photos and leaving comments throughout their split… or lack there of.\n\nKaty and Orlando originally announced their split in late February, 2017, just days after they seemed happier than ever at numerous Oscars parties. At the time their reps gave a joint statement which read, “Before rumors or falsifications get out of hand we can confirm that Orlando [Bloom] and Katy [Perry] are taking respectful, loving space at this time.”\n\nThe two stars have yet to address or confirm the wedding report.",

        "text": "If Jelena fans were still holding out hope that there was still a connection between Selena Gomez, 25, and Justin Bieber, 23, the fact that he didn’t know she underwent a top-secret kidney transplant should be proof enough that these two don’t stay in contact. The “Hands To Myself” singer shocked the world when she revealed on Sept. 14 that her best friend Francia Raisa, 29, donated one of her kidneys to Selena after her Lupus condition required the operation earlier this summer. Justin found out just like the rest of her fans via her Instagram post about it because they just don’t talk anymore.\n\n“He is hearing about this just as everyone is hearing about it. He’s he is happy that she is okay, but he has no interest in contacting her to see how she is doing. This will not be a catalyst for them to talk again. He is generally happy she is okay, but that is all he wants to deal with right now when it comes to her,” a source close to the Biebs tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. See pics from Selena’s kidney transplant, here.\n\nEven though they both go to Hillsong Church, Selena kept word of her surgery super quiet and the news never made it back to Justin, according to TMZ. The site says that the pair actively keeps their distance at services. “They don’t talk. Period,” their source claims. Another source said, “It was a childhood thing. They’ve both had other relationships. It’s over.” Isn’t that the truth! Selena’s been blissfully happy dating The Weeknd, 27, for nine months now and he was totally her “rock” during the medical crisis. Even though the singer was on tour, he stayed in constant contact to make sure his lady was doing well. Oh man, how stressful that must have been! If these two can make it through something as serious as an organ transplant ordeal, there’s nothing that can break their union.\n\nHollywoodLifers, would you donate a kidney to your BFF if they needed it?",

But they’ve decided to not focus on it for the time being.”\n\nStefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals. But the one blessing of their struggle is that it’s made them stronger than ever. The source says Shelton is “absolutely devoted” to Gwen’s sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4: “Blake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys.”\n\nRelated: Celebrity Couples and How They First Met: Love Story Beginnings Star-crossed lovers!

Says the source, “Gwen is very traditional and wouldn’t want to be pregnant without being married.”\n\nStill, things are hardly cooling off for the Voice coaches. “Their relationship has grown and matured into a stable, loving union,” explains the source. “The need to get married and have kids isn’t the priority it once was.”\n\nWhen the duo first announced they were dating in November 2015, they were both going through emotional divorces. Stefani split from the father of her boys, Gavin Rossdale, after being married for 13 years, and Shelton had recently ended his four-year union with Miranda Lambert.\n\nNow, the pair have settled in to an “easy, effortless love” together, says the source. That includes spending plenty of time on Shelton’s Oklahoma ranch — something the glamour girl surprisingly adores! Another favorite activity? “Gwen loves hanging out with Blake’s friends and wives,” says the source. The low-key loves enjoyed a couples’ trip with pals in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, this January.\n\nFor more on the couple’s decision to put their baby plans on hold, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.",

        "text": "CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device\n\nWhen Khloe Kardashian gave birth Thursday morning to her first child, the baby’s father, Tristan Thompson, was there despite the cheating scandal swirling around him, TMZ and other outlets reported.\n\nKardashian gave birth to her daughter around 4 a.m at a hospital outside Cleveland. Her mother Kris Jenner and sisters Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian also were there. The baby’s name and other details were not reported.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers player had also been invited into the delivery room, despite the fact that he reportedly left Kardashian devastated and “ballistic” after news broke this week that he had been unfaithful to her with multiple women.\n\nTMZ reported that the 33-year-old reality TV star, in her ninth month of pregnancy, began having contractions Wednesday amid all the turmoil of the cheating allegations.\n\nKardashian had relocated to Thompson’s hometown of Cleveland to enjoy the final stretch of her pregnancy and to give birth to her baby at an area hospital. When news surfaced about Thompson and his alleged trysts with other women, it was too late in her pregnancy for her to fly back to Los Angeles. Kris Jenner and Kim and Kourtney Kardashian rushed to Cleveland to be by her side.\n\nAs for having Thompson with her, sources told TMZ that Khloe Kardashian understood the importance of the birth in the lives of everyone involved and believed that the bond between her daughter and Thompson could be cemented in the delivery room.\n\n“The Kardashians are furious with Tristan, but despite what happened in New York, Khloé really wanted him there for the birth of their daughter,” a source told Page Six.\n\nThompson’s presence in the delivery room came hours after he and his team lost to the lowly New York Knicks at Cleveland’s Quicken Loans Arena. Thompson didn’t receive a very warm welcome back at his home arena. TMZ and People both reported that people in the crowd booed when he joined the game late in the first quarter.\n\nKardashian’s labor started the day after reports began surfacing in various outlets that her NBA boyfriend had cheated on her in October, when she was three months pregnant, and more recently over the weekend, when he was traveling with his team in New York City.\n\nThe Daily Mail, TMZ and other outlets on Tuesday published photos and videos of Thompson, 27, making out with a curvy brunette at a club in New York City on Saturday night and then later entering a hotel room with the woman. She was subsequently identified by the Daily Mail and Page Six as an Instagram model and strip club bartender named Lani Blair.\n\nTMZ also published a video of Thompson, shot by a surveillance camera in October 2017, at a Washington D.C. hookah lounge. Thompson is seen in the video making out with two women and allowing the women to grope him.\n\nOne of the women in the video told TMZ Wednesday that she had no idea Thompson was in a serious relationship with Khloe Kardashian when she and he had their “fling.”\n\nA report in People magazine on Wednesday quoted an “insider” as saying that the cheating allegations were “a long time coming.”\n\n“Tristan has been consistently cheating on Khloé,” the source told People. “He’s a serial cheater. And there will be more women to come out of the woodwork.”\n\nThis is not the turn in her relationship that Khloe Kardashian likely expected, certainly not recently when she posted happy baby bump photos of her in romantic, sexy poses with her baby daddy.\n\nKardashian and Thompson began dating in September 2016, with the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star soon proclaiming that she thought Thompson was the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with.\n\nIn a June 2017 episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” she gushed about how she and Thompson had talked about starting a family together. “He wants to have five or six kids with me and that’s lovely. We could start at one and grow from there,” Kardashian said.\n\nKardashian and the rest of her famous family soon become regular fixtures at Cavaliers games. In December 2017, she announced her pregnancy by sharing a snap of her bare baby bump.\n\nBut the idea that Thompson would make loyal boyfriend/husband/father material seemed a stretch, given that he broke up with his previous girlfriend, Jordan Craig, while she was pregnant. Craig gave birth to their son, Prince, in December 2016 after he had begun to see Kardashian.\n\nThis story is developing.",

        "text": "The battle between the contestants on the current season of The Voice is nothing compared to the explosive war between longtime country coach Blake Shelton and newbie judge Kelly Clarkson ! The two dueling divas went at it on-camera this week over who will nab this season's country star contestant and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned their fighting didn't stop when camera's quit rolling. Find out what was said backstage that might cause Shelton to l iterally \"Walk Away!\"\n\nClarkson, 35 — whose mother-in-law happens to be country legend Reba McIntyre — came in swinging against existing coaches Shelton, 41, Adam Levine, 39, and Alicia Keys, 37, on her first season as a judge on The Voice!\n\nRadarOnline.com was the first to report that there was some serious bad blood between Shelton and Clarkson prior to the season starting. In an interview at that time, Shelton said, “Make no mistake, Kelly is my friend, But when she's on this show, she is my enemy.”\n\nThat became clear on Monday night's episode, when the two went at it over country music contestants Wilkes , 33, and Jordan Kirkdorffer, 28. When it became clear to Shelton that Clarkson wanted to steal his top contenders, he said, \"This is not a dating game. This is 'The Voice.'\" But their bickering didn't end there, RadarOnline.com has learned.\n\nAccording to an on-set source, \"Kelly and Blake's relationship off-camera is even worse than it is on-camera. But they are like brother and sister. They fight, scream at each other and then they get over it.\"\n\n\"They are together like every day now and it's gotten to the point where she just walks away because she can't win an argument with Blake. No one can because he is always right,\" the insider revealed.\n\nAs fans know, Clarkson inked an enormous contract to join The Voice this season and it seems to have been worth it, as the show's ratings have been through the roof — destroying competitor American Idol. \"Blake went off on her over how much money she is getting paid and how unfair it is,\" the source said. \"They fight over stupid things, like the size of a dressing room.\"\n\n\"Blake loves to push Kelly's buttons and she gets upset so easily. But their chemistry is undeniable and at the end of the day, they both have nothing but love for each other,\" the insider added.\n\nWe pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

        "text": "Here’s another plot twist in Kourtney Kardashian’s love life. The KUWTK star is allegedly pregnant after publicly being seen with “what appeared to be a bump” in L.A. on July 30, a new report by OK! magazine claims! “It was strange to see because she’s usually so perfectly svelte,” a source told the outlet, and a friend to Kourt added, “Everyone is whispering that she’s pregnant with her fourth child.” If Kourtney is supposedly pregnant, then who on Earth is the father to baby number four? And by that, we mean, is it once again baby daddy Scott Disick, 35, or ex-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25? Naturally, one would assume it’s the younger model, who to the world was Kourtney’s boyfriend up until recently. But Kourtney’s anonymous friend makes a shocking claim — it’s more than likely Scott!\n\n“They’ve been meeting up on the down-low for a while now,” the friend said, going so far as to add that Kourtney and Scott hooked up in Mexico. Keep in mind, Scott has been dating model Sofia Richie, 19, since 2017 – but reportedly, that was not on Scott’s mind when he allegedly hooked up with Kourtney in a “recent” trip to Mexico, the magazine claims! “They made it look like a family trip because their kids [Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3] were there, but they hooked up,” the source said before adding, “Everyone is buzzing that she’s carrying Scott’s baby.” As far as we know, Kourtney and Scott, who broke up in 2015, haven’t publicly taken a family vacay with the kids in Mexico since 2016. But they did go to Punta Mita, Mexico just days apart with their respective lovers in January. Scott then returned to Mexico for a Cabo San Lucas getaway with the kids, but it was Sofia who played mommy. Is the magazine insinuating that Kourtney was a secret stow-away? The friend went on to say that Kourtney wouldn’t fret over Scott being her baby daddy again because “all of their kids came out beautifully.”\n\nAnd apparently, Kourtney and Younes weren’t together for as long as most assumed. News just broke on Aug. 8 that Kourtney actually ended her relationship with the 25-year-old model on the second week of July because he cheated on her. Still, if Kourtney’s alleged baby bump wasn’t just a mistaken case of bloating, then Younes could very well be the father. It takes between 12 to 16 weeks for a bump to show. Sixteen weeks ago, Kourt and Younes were still very much on! Despite all the speculations, everyone’s stumped. Even Kourtney supposedly “isn’t sure how to handle this situation.” The friend added that Kourtney “isn’t saying if the daddy is Scott, Younes or another mystery man she’s been spending time with…it may end up taking some of Kris [Jenner’s] management skills to straighten out this mess!”\n\nMaybe this report isn’t so wild, after a source close to Sofia EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com on Aug. 7 that Sofia gave her boyfriend an ultimatum – it’s her or Kourtney! Is Sofia feeling threatened, which would only make the hookup rumors between Scott and Kourtney appear to be more than gossip? “[Sofia] wants to live a life with Scott, have a future with Scott and have kids with Scott,” our source told us. “So if he is thinking of getting back with Kourtney she wants none of it.”\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to Younes Bendjima’s and Scott Disick’s reps for a comment.",

George wants to make sure the twins enter the world in the most royal manner possible.\n\nAccording to entertainment portal Aceshowbiz.com, the Hollywood star has rented out the entire Kensington Wing at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, which essentially comes down to $580,000 for a week's stay. Amal is also apparently flying in two 'birth companions' from Los Angeles for around $30,000. George also wants Amal to be completely relaxed during the birth, which is why he hired an Italian masseuse for the hotshot lawyer for $5,000.\n\nThe couple is already known to be pretty generous with their money. Amidst reports that they might spend a million dollars on their nursery, George and Amal reportedly gave their neighbours a £45,000 compensation package for the noise caused by the renovations to their estate recently. The package was said to include a holiday to Corfu, a six-week stay in a luxury hotel and a £30,000 lump sum. In addition, the Clooneys paid for their neighbours to rent a £780,000 cottage.\n\nRecently, George was advised on raising twins by Prince Albert of Monaco, who has twins himself. He said \"George should pour himself a good cup of coffee each morning.\" He also added that he'd better get \"some sleep stored away before the babies are born\".",

        "text": "\"Of course I didn’t trust them,\" she shares about her decision to keep that side of her life private.\n\nIf you thought 2018 might be the year that Caitlyn Jenner mends fences with Kris Jenner and the Kardashian siblings, then think again. Caitlyn sat down with Piers Morgan this week on Life Stories where she very candidly discussed why she kept her ex-wife and stepchildren out of the loop when it came time for to have her gender reassignment surgery.\n\nThe former Olympian was quite candid about her reasoning, sharing with the talk show host: “No, I didn’t tell anybody. It’s none of their business. No, it’s not that big a deal.”\n\nLater, Piers asked Caitlyn if she didn't trust her family to keep her secret. Her response? “Of course not, of course I didn’t trust them.”\n\nCaitlyn later continued, “I’d already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half, nobody knows anything. I didn’t want them to leak it to the press and there was no reason for them to know about it.”\n\nRelated\n\nCaitlyn was more open about her life in her 2017 memoir, The Secrets of My Life, which caused a rift between the former Olympian and Kris' ex and kids. In fact, back in November, Caitlyn revealed that things remained strained, so much so that she shared it had been about a year since she spoke to Kim Kardashian. In her interview with Piers Morgan, she shared why she spilled all in her book, but kept her family in the dark: “I had to because I had to be honest. The book is about honesty.”\n\nCaitlyn, however, does appear to remain close to her kids that she had with Kris. She was spotted with Kendall Jenner just this week and has remained quiet about rumors that Kylie Jenner is pregnant.",

But on Friday, photographers saw the aftermath of what looked like a nasty argument between the two, who have been together since 1983 but never walked down the aisle. Look at RadarOnline.com 's gallery of Hawn and Russell's surprising dustup.\n\nHawn, 71, left her Malibu house looking angry after an apparent disagreement with Russell, 65. The usually bubbly former Laugh-In star was clearly in no laughing mood as she scowled while walking to her white Range Rover.\n\nLooking disheveled as she wore a sloppy sweater and no makeup, Hawn reached up to slam her car's trunk in disgust after the incident.\n\nOn Britain's ITV chat show, Loose Women, Hawn said she and Russell \"would have been long divorced\" if they had wed.\n\nHawn has said she and the rugged Escape from New York star \"liked the choice\" of not marrying each other. However they did have a son, Wyatt , together.\n\nThe star who had a big hit with Private Benjamin doesn't look camera ready as, in her obvious anger, she forgot to close her car door. Hawn was driving through Malibu when she realized her mistake and pulled over to slam the passenger side shut.\n\nShortly after Hawn left, Russell emerged from the house and stared at a traffic cone wedged under his GMC truck. He drove away with the cone still stuck under the vehicle.\n\nHawn and Russell are going into their golden years together and both look great for their age. The giggly gal is never afraid of showing off her body at Hollywood events or on vacation, as RadarOnline.com's photo have shown.\n\nWhile they've stood the test of time, Hawn has admitted that celebrities may have \"a harder time\" with relationships because \"the cameras are on them all the time.\" Indeed!\n\nWe pay for juicy info!

It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.\n\nCecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.\n\nThis huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.\n\nAngelina Jolie’s Hidden Hills Mansion — PICS\n\nThe actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?",

They have issues just like any other couple.\"\n\nThe pair started dating in 2010 and had been on and off until 2015. They reconnected late last year and have kept their relationship very private, as Selena continues to put her health issues and personal needs first. The 25-year-old \"Wolves\" singer suffers from lupus and underwent a kidney transplant last year.\n\n\"She's still working hard, looking after her health, and doing what's good for her,\" the source notes. \"Justin isn't walking all over her.\"\n\nET previously reported that Gomez’s friends and family, particularly her mother, Mandy Teefey, struggled with the couple’s reunion, given the pair’s ups and downs in the past. According to the source, that conflict continues to play a part in her relationship with Bieber.\n\n\"It's not easy for Selena to be stuck in the middle,” the source says. \"Her family not liking him is the biggest issue -- but if they can get through that or if her family changes their tune, things will be a lot smoother.\"\n\nDespite the drama, the singer publicly acknowledged her rekindled romance with Bieber for the first time last week on his 24th birthday. \"March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom,\" Gomez wrote alongside a picture of her laughing with a Polaroid of Bieber on her forehead.\n\nSee more on the pair’s reconciliation in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

        "text": "Did Demi Lovato‘s overdose really make Wilmer Valderrama, 38, realize that he wants to marry her? — The answer is NO, despite a report which has claimed otherwise. “Marriage with Demi at one point in Wilmer’s life was something that was talked about while they were dating,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “There were many occasions where he almost popped the question.” However, that was then and this is now. “Wilmer has been broken up with Demi for a while, and even though she is going through a tough time, it’s not giving him thoughts on getting back together with her or to marry her,” the insider says.\n\nThere is absolutely no bad blood, the source reveals, noting that Wilmer paid Demi multiple visits in the hospital during her recovery. Ultimately, he just wants the best for his ex, especially in terms of her health. “Wilmer wants Demi to be healthy,” the insider says, explaining, “He wants his friend to live a successful and healthy life.” — “A relationship further than that is not something Wilmer is interested in pursuing right now. Its just not the time to think about anything like that. The matter of Demi getting better and on the right path is everything that is on Wilmer’s mind. Not romance.”\n\nDemi was allegedly found unconscious after a drug overdose inside her Hollywood Hills home after a night of heavy partying with friends on Tuesday, July 24. A friend inside her home called 911, pleading with the dispatcher that they needed to get help as soon as possible. Demi reportedly received Narcan, a lifesaving drug, which counteracts opioids.However, it’s unclear which drug(s) she took. After being admitted to the hospital, Demi’s rep confirmed to HollywoodLife that she was “awake and with her family.” The rep also confirmed that some of the information being reported is “incorrect.” It was originally reported that Demi allegedly overdosed on heroin, however, the report was retracted.\n\nDemi has since agreed to enter rehab, which is where she will travel to when she is released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA. The singer later released a statement on Instagram on August 6, which read in part: “I want to thank God for keeping me alive and well. To my fans, I am forever grateful for all of your love and support throughout this past week and beyond. Your positive thoughts and prayers have helped me navigate through this difficult time.” Just one month before her overdose, Demi released a new song titled “Sober,” in which she admitted she was no longer sober from drugs and alcohol after six years.\n\nDemi was on tour amidst her overdose. The singer has since canceled the rest of her “Tell Me You Love Me Tour,” to seek treatment.",

However, recent reports are claiming that former boyfriend of Kristen Stewart is hooking up with American singer Katy Perry.\n\nIs the ‘Twilight’ actor cheating on his fiancée?\n\nGossip Cop was quick to debunk the claims saying that Robert Pattinson is hooking up with Katy Perry. The publication claimed that the former boyfriend of Kristen Stewart is not seeing the “Roar” singer behind the back of FKA Twigs.\n\nTMZ previously claimed that Pattinson and Perry were spotted getting flirty with each other at the Sunset Tower Hotel.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, the former partners of Kristen Stewart and Orlando Bloom were eating with a number of friends but they later separated with the crowd later that night.\n\nSpeculations have it that Robert Pattinson and Katy Perry started secretly seeing each other following the latter’s split with the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor. This, according to TMZ, is amid the reports that the “New Moon” star is affianced to FKA Twigs.\n\nWhile these romance rumors could possibly be true, Gossip Cop claimed that these reports are completely made up. As a matter of fact, Pattinson has reiterated on the “Howard Stern Show” that he is tying the knot with Twigs soon.\n\nMoreover, Us Weekly shared Katy Perry has also divulged that she and Robert Pattinson are just friends.\n\nThe “Thinking of You” songstress added that she treats FKA Twigs’ fiancé as a brother.\n\nPerry even said that she never slept with Pattinson. The former BFF of Taylor Swift also emphasized that there is no bad blood between her and Kristen Stewart.\n\nIs the ‘Teenage Dream’ singer using Kristen Stewart’s ex-bf?\n\nMeanwhile, Celeb Dirty Laundry has claimed Katy Perry could possibly be using Robert Pattinson to break into acting.\n\nThe rumor website claimed that this could be the American songstress’ strategy to gain a position into an acting career.\n\n“When you consider that acting street cred as being one of the things that Katy Perry is so desperately seeking, it’s not difficult to put two and two together,” CDL claimed. The publication even added that this is not the very first time that Pattinson is being used by someone for fame since Twigs allegedly had the same scheme.\n\nRobert Pattinson, FKA Twigs and Katy Perry have yet to comment on these allegations. Hence, fans should take these speculations with a grain of salt until everything is proven true and correct. After all, Celeb Dirty Laundry is known to be a spreader of baseless rumors.

        "text": "The death of legendary Allman Brothers co-founder Gregg Allman sent the music industry into despair, with many stars sharing their sympathies on Twitter.\n\nThe southern-blues rocker died at his home in Savannah, Georgia on Saturday, at the age of 69. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1999 and underwent a liver transplant in 2010, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMusicians like John Mayer, Peter Frampton and Keith Urban shared memories and photos of Allman after hearing the news. “He showed me his tattoos… his voice…. his soul. #GreggAllman,” tweeted Melissa Etheridge under a photo of herself with Allman.\n\nAllman’s ex-wife Cher struggled to find words to express her sadness: “IVE TRIED…WORDS ARE IMPOSSIBLE GUI GUI💔 FOREVER, CHOOCH💋,” she wrote.\n\nA mix of love and shock from celebrities continues to pour in over social media:\n\nHealth battles had forced Allman to cancel upcoming June concert dates, but the guitarist denied rumors that he was currently in hospice care. In April, the guitarist posted a message on social media in which he clarified his current health status.\n\n“Hey everyone. I just wanted y’all to know that I’m currently home in Savannah resting on my doctor’s orders,” he wrote. “I want to thank you for all the love that you are sending. Looking forward to seeing everyone again. Keep Rockin.”\n\nAllman fronted his band for 45 years, first alongside Duane and then as its sole namesake, after his older brother — a rock history luminary — was killed in a motorcycle accident in November 1971.",

        "text": "Like Blake Lively’s recently purged Instagram photos, the actress’ latest character has gone missing in the new trailer for Bridesmaids helmer Paul Feig’s upcoming mystery A Simple Favor.\n\n“I do consider Emily my best friend. She’s this wonderful, elegant person,” Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie) says of Lively’s character in the preview, which the latter debuted Wednesday morning via her Twitter account. Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding, who plays Emily’s husband, Sean, continues: “She is an enigma, my wife. You can get close to her, but never quite reach her.”\n\nAs quick flashes of police sirens, a violent car crash, and deliciously smirky glances flash onscreen, Emily reminds us: “Everybody has a dark side. Some of us are better at hiding it than others.”\n\nThe biggest reveal the trailer presents, however, is Emily grinning in a crimson wig after Stephanie explains: “Five days ago, Emily went missing. I’m realizing I don’t know her as well as I thought I did. Emily, if you’re out there, we’re all really worried!”\n\nIn anticipation of the trailer’s release, Lively sent fans into a tizzy Monday by deleting all of her Instagram posts save for a single photo of a hangman-style game which spelled out the question, “What happened to Emily?” As of Wednesday, Lively unfollowed most of the accounts she previously tracked, and is now following only women named Emily Nelson — 37 of them, to be exact.\n\nA Simple Favor — also starring Rupert Friend, Jean Smart, Linda Cardellini, Andrew Rannells, and Sarah Baker — is set for release on Sept. 14. Watch the film’s trailer above.",

News, the call was made from Disick’s home, though the identity of the patient remains unclear.\n\nEntertainment Tonight reported the same, adding that the Los Angeles County Fire Department confirmed that the patient, who was male, was non-violent when authorities arrived at the residence before being transported to the hospital.\n\nA 5150 hold is an involuntary psychiatric hold that occurs when a person is deemed to be a danger to either themselves or others. The patient can be held in a psychiatric hospital for up to 72 hours, unless it is extended. According to The Blast, Disick was released prior to that.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Scott Disick Is ‘Over His Own Stupid Behavior,’ Source Says\n\n“Scott is definitely trying to get better, but he still has bad moments,” a source tells PEOPLE. “When he starts partying, he doesn’t know when to stop. It’s concerning to see. Everyone hopes he’ll continue on a good path.”\n\nSince Aug. 18, Disick has been spotted in public several times, most recently in New York City for Fashion Week, dining with Kim Kardashian at Milo’s restaurant Wednesday night.\n\nEarlier this week, a source told PEOPLE that the 34-year-old is working on bettering himself after a summer of partying hard. The insider said Disick is now monitoring his drinking and has “been feeling better.”\n\n“He’s been really good. He was just in Vegas and didn’t drink,” the source said. “When he felt like he was about to slip, he would call friends who talked him off the edge.”\n\n“He was definitely spiraling for a while,” the source added. “But he got fed up with himself and was over his own stupid behavior.”\n\nDisick’s antics throughout the months of May and June put serious strain on his relationship with ex Kourtney Kardashian, but the pair reunited with their three children — sons Mason, 7, and Reign, 2, and daughter Penelope, 5 — in mid-July for a low-key family getaway to Nantucket.\n\nAccording to the source, his relationship with Kourtney, 38, has been improving.\n\n“He was just tired,” the source said, adding that Disick working on himself has “been good for his relationship with Kourtney.”",

        "text": "Is Heather Locklear Joining RHOBH?!\n\nThe actress might be getting her own diamond!\n\nGenny Glassman\n\nIn a turn of events that would truly be shocking, is it possible that actress Heather Locklear will be joining the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills? We’re not so sure that this story checks out.\n\nThe buzz started yesterday, April 9, when Lisa Rinna was a guest on Andy Cohen’s radio show, Radio Andy. The two talked Housewives, Amelia’s history with mental health, and Andy even probed Lisa about her relationship her former Melrose Place co-star.\n\n“Did you have a friendship with [Heather Locklear]?” the Bravo host asked.\n\n“I did and I will say to you, I learned more from Heather […] I learned professionalism, coming in and owning a set, and being kind to everyone, and polite, and on time, knew their lines, funny,” Rinna tells him. “Heather Locklear was everything and she was one of the biggest starts of that time.”\n\nBut things have not been smooth sailing for Locklear as of late. “It’s sad whatever demons she’s dealing with,” Andy says.\n\nOf course Andy is referring to Locklear’s brush with the law that happened earlier this year. In February, People reported that the ’90s icon was arrested on suspicion of domestic battery against her then-boyfriend, Chris Heisser, and three counts of battery on a police officer.\n\nReportedly, Locklear started the altercation when she threw a Red Bull can at Heisser because she felt that he had “lied to her.” She told police officers that Heisser had then tried to strangle her in retaliation, and while these validity of these claims proved to be inconclusive, (Heisser denies these claims, saying “I never touched her”), police did find blood on the bridge of Heisser’s nose and red marks across his chest. He told them that Locklear had attacked him, “bit his face,” and struck him from anywhere “between 20 – 30 minutes.” When police arrived, things got ugly quickly and the night ended with Locklear in a pair of handcuffs yelling at police, “You f***ing deserve your kids to die! You f***ing deserve it!” Yikes.\n\nSo is Heather strong enough to duke it out with the ladies of the RHOBH? “You know it was my fantasy — wouldn’t it have been great to get Heather on the Beverly Hills Housewives?” Andy tells Rinna.\n\n“Maybe we still can,” Lisa Rinna answers.\n\n“Start checking it with her,” Andy pleads.\n\nNaturally anyone who brings the drama is prime housewives material in our book, but in the case of Heather Locklear we think that this is one rumor that should stay a fantasy.\n\nLet us know, do you think Heather Locklear should be on reality TV?",

The happy news comes shortly after the couple went public with their relationship after reportedly dating for two years. How exciting!\n\n“[Katie’s] adjusted her workout and is avoiding alcohol,” the insider told OK! Magazine. “They’ve also started talking with friends about their future as a family. They aren’t confirming a pregnancy yet, but they’re not denying it either. They’re thrilled [their relationship is] finally out in the open. Neither of them wanted to sneak around anymore.”\n\nThat’s amazing! Katie, of course, has a child with ex-husband Tom Cruise — 11-year-old Suri Cruise. Jamie is the father of two beautiful daughters from prior relationships: Corinne, 23, and Annalise, 8. Giving the girls a half-sibling would make this one, big, happy family. It’s unclear when Jamie and Katie would announce their alleged pregnancy, but eagle-eyed paps seem to think it’ll be soon. The couple were spotted walking on the beach in Los Angeles, and Katie was wearing an uncharacteristically large, flowy dress. Could she be hiding a baby bump? Maybe! Or, maybe she just wants to be comfortable for a casual outing! Let the woman live!https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/09/11/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-happy-dating-tom-cruise-relationship/\n\nBaby or not, Katie and Jamie are having the time of their lives right now. As a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, Katie feels happier now with Jamie than she ever did when she was married to Tom. Katie “adores his sense of humor,” and can see him becoming a wonderful father figure to Suri — who reportedly hasn’t seen her own father in four years. A separate source close to Katie told us EXCLUSIVELY that Katie’s happy with the way things are and not in a rush to get married. They didn’t say anything about a baby, though!\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to both Katie and Jamie’s reps for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you believe that Katie is actually pregnant with Jamie’s baby?

Three days later, the lovebirds emerged once again at Santa Monica’s decidedly more-low key Jack in the Box drive-thru. With fries and a cheeseburger in hand, the all-smiles duo sped off in his Range Rover. According to a witness, “They looked so happy together.”\n\nSomething was off, however. The passenger was not his love of more than a year, Lindsay Shookus — but 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton. Not only had Affleck, 46, and the Saturday Night Live producer, 38, quietly split — “it’s amicable,” says a source — in just two weeks, the actor had also reverted back to his womanizing ways. It’s a behavior his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, knows all too well. While still with Garner, Affleck began secretly dating Shookus. And just weeks after the parents of Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, announced the end of their decade-long marriage, Affleck moved on with their then 28-year-old nanny, Christine Ouzounian.\n\n“Jen realized a long time ago that she cannot fix Ben and that his problems are not hers to solve,” a Garner confidant reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. “She’s not his babysitter. She just wants to protect the kids. But she does wish Ben would keep his life more private.”\n\nRelated: Celebrity Splits 2018 Calling it quits.

(After photos of them hit the internet, Shookus deleted her Instagram account.) Evenings out aside, Affleck and Playboy’s Miss May 2018 have clocked plenty of hours holed up in his $20 million, seven-bedroom Pacific Palisades bachelor pad, says an insider — much to the dismay of Garner.\n\nRelated: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner: The Way They Were Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their split after 10 years of marriage on June 30, 2015. From their first public outing, to welcoming daughters Violet and Seraphina, and son Samuel, look back at the way they were.\n\n“Of course she’s not pleased he’s dating a 22-year-old Playboy model,” says the Garner confidant. “But she’s also not surprised. Jen has come to expect this from Ben. She’s not going to get involved. She can’t make decisions for him.”\n\nFor more on Garner and Affleck, pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now!",

Now, it is being revealed he has a big request for the President — and it involves his youngest daughter Chicago.\n\n“Kanye’s infatuated with Trump and is considering asking POTUS to be Chicago’s godfather,” a source told In Touch exclusively. “He loves, respects, and admires Trump and feels a man of his prestige and power would be a perfect influence in children’s lives.”\n\nHowever, his wife Kim Kardashian is completely opposed to the idea. “She despises Trump and doesn’t like what he stands for and is telling Kanye that he needs to choose somebody else. Kanye’s adamant that he wants to ask Trump and it’s resulted in them having a huge blowout argument,” the source added. “Trump is a huge no no for Kim but Kanye’s really a huge fan and supporter of his and that’s a bone of contention in their marriage.”\n\nIn case you were wondering, North and Saint West‘s godmothers are Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian, respectively. However, their godfathers have never been revealed.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that friends were worried the “Faded” rapper are worried about his current mental health after he spoke with radio host Ebro and allegedly said he loved Trump — along with claim he had an opioid addiction. On Twitter, Kanye has denied the allegations.\n\n“There’s been a lot of fake news so I just wanted to give you the facts,” he wrote. “Yeezy will become the biggest apparel company in human history by working with the most genius level talents and creating product at an affordable price. I hired the head of supply chain from the Gap.” He also called himself this generation’s “Ford Hughes Jobs Disney.”\n\nLet’s hope Kim wins this godfather battle.",

Some of the stories might have a nugget of truth hidden in them, but most are just so out there that they couldn’t possible have any merit, right?\n\nThe most recent rumor says that Grande forces her staff to carry her like a baby, according to In Touch magazine. “Her new rule is that she has to be carried — literally like a baby — when she doesn’t feel like walking,” a source told the magazine. “She says she doesn’t want her precious feet to hit the floor.”\n\nMore: 11 Times Ariana Grande tried really hard to be Mariah Carey\n\nHere are some other outlandish rumors about Grande that have popped up.\n\n1. She refused to do the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge\n\nAccording to Star magazine, Grande would not film herself having ice dumped over her head because she refuses to be seen without her hair extensions or full makeup. “Celebrities all over the world are doing it for a good cause, but she doesn’t care,” Star says a source told them. “Her skin is a big problem for her and she absolutely does not want to be seen barefaced.”\n\n2. She threatens lighting crews with drastic measures if they mess up\n\nIn August, Grande allegedly berated a lighting crew and made sure she was only shot from certain angles. “She was a total nightmare,” a source told Star. “She demanded to be shot only on her left side and told the lighting crew that if they used red light, she would ‘kill herself.'”\n\nMore: Harsh! Did Bette Midler just call Ariana Grande a ‘whore’?\n\n3. She has an assistant feed her water with a straw\n\n“She had an assistant follow her around with a bottle of water and a straw,” a witness told Star. “And as soon as she was feeling a bit parched, she would scream ‘Water!’ and the girl would scurry over… At one point, the water was too warm for her liking, so she spit it out!”\n\n4. She elbowed Giuliana Rancic in the side\n\nGrande allegedly strong-armed Rancic into moving out of her way during an interview, again to make sure she was only seen from her good side. It seems that this rumor might actually be true, because the allegations come straight from Rancic’s mouth. “I remember, I think I was at the AMAs, she came up on the platform and normally I stand on this side to the camera,” Rancic said, according to Perez Hilton. “Little Ariana comes over like all bink [mimics an elbow jab] with an elbow in my side. I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ And they pushed me to the other side.”\n\n5. She wished death upon her fans\n\nAccording to a source, Grande was all smiles while signing autographs for fans earlier this year, but said some pretty brutal things as soon as they were out of earshot. “As soon as the doors [of an elevator] shut she said, ‘I hope they all f***ing die,'” an insider told the New York Daily News.\n\n6. She ordered her security to delete a fan’s camera photos\n\nA couple of very disappointed fans took to Twitter after meeting Grande, who was alleged very distant and snubbed them at a meet and greet.\n\nWe won a #MTV contest to meet @ArianaGrande & we ended up in tears. Disappointed our idol would treat us like this 😔 pic.twitter.com/afeb7irAJv — Jennifer O'Connor (@HerNamesJen) August 24, 2014\n\n@ArianaGrande My sister & I were huge fans. u made @HerNamesJen extremely sad by walking away from her & telling me to delete all my pics. — Kelle Jansky (@KelleJansky) August 26, 2014\n\nWhat do you think? Is there truth to any these rumors, or are they just crazy talk?",

        "text": "What does music’s most prominent power couple gift fashion’s most prominent power couple when a new baby arrives? Well, if you’re Beyonce, 36, and JAY-Z, 48, it’s a custom-made, diamond Lorraine Schwartz bracelet, worth a whooping $21,000, according to The Sun. That’s right, Kim Kardashian, 37, and Kanye West‘s third baby — who arrived on January 15 — is about to be the most decked out infant, well… ever. And, get this — Bey and JAY reportedly had the bracelet engraved with the number “3,” to signify Kimye’s third offspring.\n\n“Beyonce and Jay could not be more pleased for them, they can’t wait to meet the little one, and have sent them this gift already,” a source told the outlet. “It shows they have all moved on from the past, and they are ‘familia’ once more.” Although all parties involved are reportedly thrilled about burying the hatchet, “Kanye is over the moon as he has always considered JAY Z his ‘big brother,’ and Beyonce has always been one of his closest friends.” Ironically, both power couples have three children each, and “it’s only a matter of time before the playdates begin,” the source added. Bey and JAY are parents to twins Sir and Rumi, who they welcomed in June 2016, and Blue Ivy, 6. Kim and Kanye are parents their daughter, North, 4, and son, Saint, 1, along with their new baby girl.\n\nWhile this report indicates that JAY-Z and Kanye’s feud is over, JAY already hinted that he wanted to bury the hatchet during an interview with The New York Times back in November 2017. “But, that happens,” JAY admitted about there being tension with Ye’. JAY explained: “In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we’re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I’m saying? There’s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, ‘These are the things that I’m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.’ I’m sure he feels that I’ve done things to him as well. You know what I’m saying? These are — I’m not a perfect human being by no stretch. You know.” JAY also said that he had recently spoken with Ye’ [at the time] and that they would always be good with each other. “I love Kanye. I do,” he said, adding, “It’s a complicated relationship with us.”\n\nAs you may know, JAY and Ye’s friendship took a hit back in 2016. In October of that year, Kanye went on a rant during one of his concerts where he slammed both JAY and Beyonce. He claimed their kids didn’t play together, and he revealed that there was tension between him and JAY because of a TIDAL music dispute. Ye’ even said that JAY and Beyonce didn’t even call after Kim’s 2016 Paris robbery. Just days after his rant, Kanye checked into UCLA Medical Center for an 8-9-day stay for an alleged mental breakdown.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Bey, JAY, Kim and Ye are all friends again?",

        "text": "ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.\n\nA person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.\n\nLaunch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.\n\nThe new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.\n\n“Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.\n\n“GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.\n\nThe expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.\n\nHaines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.",

Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott were guests at MTV’s epic awards show on Aug. 20, but some fans thought they didn’t look like they were enjoying themselves enough… especially during Jennifer Lopez’s epic medley performance!\n\nJLo was honored with the annual Video Vanguard award, but before she accepted it she performed a medley of basically every song you can think of. “Get Right,” “Jenny From The Block,” “Get On The Floor,” “Ain’t Yo Momma,” “Love Don’t Cost A Thing,” seriously, all the faves. To make it more epic, she brought out Ja Rule, DJ Khaled, and more stars to perform with her.\n\nAnd yet, when the cameras cut to the audience, they caught Kylie and Travis just sitting there, staring off into space without so much as a smile. Meanwhile, everyone around them was up out of their chairs dancing the night away, as you do.

        "text": "Who do you think is in the right?\n\nThe Queen is reportedly 'livid' with Prince William and his wife the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nAccording to Life & Style magazine, a dispute has sprung up over a conversation about Kate's royal duties. Prince William had called the Queen to suggest that his wife - who is pregnant with their third child - scale back her royal duties permanently.\n\n'Kate wants her public appearances kept to a minimum and he's 100% behind her' the source told the publication, adding that 'the conversation was quite icy.'\n\nKate is reportedly more comfortable in her role as a full time mother to George (4) and Charlotte (2) than as a working royal. The Duchess of Cambridge is currently patron to a number of charities, including The Art Room, National Portrait Gallery, East Anglia's Children's Hospice and Action on Addiction.\n\nKate Middleton (Image credit: Rex Features (Shutterstock))\n\nBut according to Life & Style, 'the 91-year-old monarch was livid that the future Queen would want to lessen her duties.'\n\nThe Queen's own experiences as a mother and working royal could be the reason she disapproves of Kate and Will's decision. She was 25 with two small children (Charles and Anne) when her father died and she ascended to the throne, and went on to have two more children (Andrew and Edward) after she was crowned, regularly leaving them at home with nursery staff while she went on official tours of the Commonwealth.\n\n(Image credit: GETTY)\n\nIn his 1994 authorised biography, Prince Charles is said to have found his parents 'emotionally reserved.' It was the nursery staff who 'taught him to play, witnessed his first steps, punished and rewarded him, helped him put his first thoughts into words' the biography claimed.\n\nThis is not the first parenting style clash between the Queen and younger generations of the royal family. She reportedly disagreed with William's mother Diana's decision to take him on tour to Australia and New Zealand when he was nine months old. Diana was said to have found the idea of being apart from William too difficult.\n\nIn a clip from her 90th birthday celebrations last year the Queen was also seen telling William to 'get up' when the family appeared on the balcony to wave at crowds - he was crouching down to show George the planes doing a fly over.\n\nWilliam and Kate have already adopted a more modern attitude to parenting than their parents and grandparents, sending George to a local Montessori nursery in Norfolk and then onto Thomas's in Battersea, where he recently had his first day of school.",

        "text": "Casey Affleck talked about the #MeToo movement in the actor’s first interview since resurfaced sexual harassment allegations forced him to avoid participating in this year’s Oscars.\n\nSpeaking to the Associated Press, Affleck discussed his decision to break tradition and skip this year’s Academy Awards, where – as winner of Best Actor for Manchester by the Sea the previous year – he was scheduled to present Best Actress; past winners Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence instead presented the award.\n\n“I think it was the right thing to do just given everything that was going on in our culture at the moment,” Affleck said. “And having two incredible women go present the best actress award felt like the right thing.”\n\nThe allegations against Affleck stem from a pair of sexual harassment civil lawsuits he faced while director of the 2010 Joaquin Phoenix quasi-documentary I’m Still Here. Although Affleck denied any wrongdoing, he ultimately settled both lawsuits.\n\nThe allegations of the harassment resurfaced during Affleck’s Best Actor campaign for Manchester by the Sea; following his Oscars win, actress Brie Larson and others refused to clap for Affleck.\n\n“First of all, that I was ever involved in a conflict that resulted in a lawsuit is something that I really regret. I wish I had found a way to resolve things in a different way. I hate that. I had never had any complaints like that made about me before in my life and it was really embarrassing and I didn’t know how to handle it and I didn’t agree with everything, the way I was being described, and the things that were said about me, but I wanted to try to make it right, so we made it right in the way that was asked at the time. And we all agreed to just try to put it behind us and move on with our lives, which I think we deserve to do, and I want to respect them as they’ve respected me and my privacy. And that’s that,” Affleck told the AP.\n\n“Over the past couple of years, I’ve been listening a lot to this conversation, this public conversation, and learned a lot. I kind of moved from a place of being defensive to one of a more mature point of view, trying to find my own culpability. And once I did that I discovered there was a lot to learn. I was a boss. I was one of the producers on the set. This movie was [shot in 2008, 2009] and I was one of the producers. And it was a crazy mockumentary, [a] very unconventional movie. The cast was the crew and the crew was kind of the cast and it was an unprofessional environment and, you know, the buck had to stop with me being one of the producers and I have to accept responsibility for that and that was a mistake.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nWith Affleck back as director on his upcoming film Light of My Life, he also talked about how the #MeToo and Time’s Up campaigns have impacted Hollywood.\n\n“I think bigger picture, in this business women have been underrepresented and underpaid and objectified and diminished and humiliated and belittled in a bazillion ways and just generally had a mountain of grief thrown at them forever. And no one was really making too much of a fuss about it, myself included, until a few women with the kind of courage and wisdom to stand up and say, ‘You know what? Enough is enough,'” Affleck said.\n\n“Those are the people who are kind of leading this conversation and should be leading the conversation. And I know just enough to know that in general I need to keep my mouth shut and listen and try to figure out what’s going on and be a supporter and a follower in the little, teeny tiny ways that I can.”\n\nAffleck next appears in The Old Man & The Gun, which also marks Robert Redford’s final acting role.",

Says Cellulite makes her feel more feminine!\n\nCaitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood.\n\nShe says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her a different sense of joy, and can’t wait to show it off.\n\nA weird article\n\nThe headline “Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!” from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this!\n\nIt said:\n\n“Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can’t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!”\n\nThat seems really weird, doesn’t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path.\n\nShe is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense.\n\nMaybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that.\n\nIt said:\n\n“She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!”\n\nMaybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh.\n\nIt is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her.\n\nIt is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality every day. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body.\n\nIt also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” And it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in the future.\n\nThe story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, Jenner might not want to do it anymore.\n\n“So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason may be her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.\n\nYou may like to read Is Caitlyn Jenner dating someone; Fake story of affair of Caitlyn Jenner and Boxer Yusaf Mack\n\nRumors or truth\n\nThis is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner.

There are many rumors which may include some truth about Jenner.\n\nAlso read Brandon Jenner states why family members were not waiting when Caitlyn Jenner got eliminated from the reality TV show!\n\nShort Bio on Caitlyn Jenner\n\nCaitlyn Jenner is a decathlete turned TV personality. She is known by her previous name “Bruce Jenner”. The Olympic gold medal winner came out as a transgender in April 2015.

        "text": "The custody battle between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie just heated up, with a judge ordering new restrictions for Jolie’s involvement in Pitt’s interaction with their six children.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Jolie could be in danger of losing primary custody of the children if she doesn’t take steps to improve their relationship with their father. A judge in the couple’s ongoing divorce case said in the documents that “it is critical that each of [the six] children have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother,” and that Jolie must allow Pitt to maintain and repair that.\n\nFamily law attorney David Glass, who is not associated with the case, tells PEOPLE that it “is extremely rare” to see a court intervene in this way, though they typically do so after extensive evaluation and to prevent children from being alienated from one parent.\n\nJason Merritt/Getty\n\n“It looks like what this judge was weighing was the difference between estrangement and alienation,” says Glass, who has not had access to the court documents. “The difference there is, estrangement is when children aren’t connected to one of the parents, mainly because of something that parent did. So a hypothetical, if dad screams and yells at the kids and doesn’t treat them nicely, the kids stop wanting to see dad, that’s estrangement. An alienation refers to where children have been told by the other parent that the parent they’re not seeing is bad, or doesn’t like them, or doesn’t care about them. Just talking badly about the other parent and the kids start to internalize what the other parent is telling them. In alienation cases, kids will typically just repeat words that are beyond their years, or they will repeat reasons that they don’t possibly have access to the information.”\n\nHe adds: “It’s a rare case where the court will find that someone alienated the kids. It takes a lot to move the court past estrangement into alienation, but once it’s determined that one parent is alienating the kids, the court has no choice but to jump in and make pretty strong orders right away.”\n\nThe judge also outlined specific steps Jolie should take to aid Pitt’s access to and relationship with the children, including a detailed summer visitation schedule, and easy phone access between Pitt and each of the kids, without monitoring or interference from their mom. Glass says that the goal of the new guidelines is to “try to figure out what’s in the children’s best interest.”\n\nDia Dipasupil/FilmMagic\n\n“The schedule worked out by the court is the typical post-alienation reunification schedule,” he says. “You see them a couple hours a day and that starts leading to full days and eventually if things go well it leads to overnights, so you’re slowly acclimating the kids to the parent who’s been cut out of the kids lives.”\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Brad Pitt Is ‘in a Better Place’ Amid Divorce Proceedings with Angelina Jolie: Source\n\nAccording to the court documents, the kids have to continue to see their therapist with Pitt, which Glass says is a positive step.\n\n“That’s the first good news, that the kids are in therapy and that dad is somehow involved in the therapy. That’s where the kids can work out whatever issues they have. It’s that continuing contact with dad … all those little pieces that eventually lead to some sort of reunification with their dad.”\n\nReps for both Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, have not yet responded to a request for comment. Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt on September 19, 2016. The have six children: Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 9-year old twins Vivienne and Knox.",

        "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been pretty clear about their desire to start a family eventually. But a new report from Us Weekly has it that the timeline for baby #1 has become accelerated after the royal wedding. Multiple sources have told the outlet that after the ceremony, the two's desire for having kids grew. “Having children is definitely a priority,” a source close to Markle told Us. “She and Harry want to start a family right away—and she’ll start trying as soon as she can.”\n\nA second source that the outlet describes as a royal insider echoed this, though was a little less \"this'll happen ASAP.\" “They both can’t wait to start a family. [Still,] Harry and Meghan won’t rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They’ll make fantastic parents.”\n\nA third source chimed in that even Markle's mom Doria Ragland believes that baby will come soon. “Doria is expecting to be a grandmother by this time next year. She’s very excited for Meghan to become a mother.”\n\nHarry and Markle are currently believed to be on their honeymoon, though they are expected to attend the Queen's Trooping of the Colour official birthday parade this Saturday. They have a trip planned to Australia this fall for the Sydney Invictus Games and are said to have a busy second half of the year coming with work engagements. Whether a pregnancy announcement will come before or after all that, we'll see.\n\nIn their first interview together after announcing their engagement, Markle and Harry made it clear they hope to have children someday. When asked about their plans to start a family, Harry said, \"No [not now], of course, you know, one step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.\"\n\nAt an event in March, Markle hinted that future is nearer rather than farther. The two met a wife-husband entrepreneur duo Sinead and Adam Murphy, who showed the couple products from their Shnuggle line, which include a baby bath and Moses basket. Markle quipped to them, \"I’m sure at some point we’ll need the whole thing.”",

And this year, Hollywood upped their game — with shocking haircuts, major announcements and one scary on-set prank.\n\nStar Trek star George Takei kicked things off, announcing in the early minutes of Saturday that he was planning a run for Congress in 2018 — targeting California’s 22nd District so he can take on Republican Devin Nunes.\n\nTakei told The Daily Buzz that he wanted to take a bigger stand in politics. “With what is going on now in the country, I couldn’t stand by any longer merely as a citizen,” Takei said. “I knew I had to take a bigger stand. So that’s why I’m running for Congress. My hope is to challenge Devin Nunes for his seat in 2018.”\n\nThe 79-year-old actor let the world wait over 8 hours before revealing the truth — tweeting a photo of him holding a sign that read, “Gotcha!”\n\n“No, I’m not running for Congress. Happy 4/1!,” he wrote. “But Jon Ossoff is on 4/18. Help him win at electjon.com. Let’s flip Congress in ’18.”\n\nMinutes before Takei’s reveal, swimming champion Michael Phelps took his own stab at an April’s Fools Day prank — tweeting that he was ready to come out of retirement to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n“Some dreams/goals you just can’t get rid of,” the 41-year-old athlete wrote. “Been doing a lot of thinking n I’ve decided that I’m going 2 make another comeback! #tokyo2020.”\n\nSadly, for those hoping the 23-time gold medalist would be trying build on his historic success after his last Olympic Games wrapped in Rio, they’re out of luck.\n\nTeam USA quickly screen-grabbed the tweet, posting it to Instagram with the caption “#aprilfools.”\n\nFROM COINAGE: These Athletes Are Only Getting Richer After Leaving the Field\n\nRebel Wilson‘s April Fools Day prank had everyone scrambling on the set of Pitch Perfect 3.\n\nThe 37-year-old comedian laid on the ground outside one of the film’s trailers, as concerned cast members and crew came to her aid.\n\nBefore things got too serious, some of the folks who were in on the prank screamed “April Fools!” — as seen in video of the prank Wilson posted to Instagram.\n\n“Tragic accident on the set of Pitch Perfect 3,” she wrote. “Just kidding! Happy April Fools Pitches! I got you!!!”\n\nFor all the Bravoholics out there, Real Housewives of New York City star Bethenny Frankel had a surprise on Saturday — posting a shot of herself on Instagram with a new pixie haircut.\n\nShe captioned the shot, “#shorthairdontcare” and “#newseasonnewlook” (among others).\n\nOf course, anyone following Frankel on Snapchat would know the 46-year-old Skinnygirl mogul was just joking around — as her she’s been showing off her bob on the social media site while skiing with her 6-year-old daughter, Bryn.\n\nGigi Hadid also pulled a hairdo prank, sharing a shot of herself with what appeared to be short hair and scissor emojis. However she later updated the caption to share that it was just a prank.",

The gunman was over by the third base dugout with a clear view of the field.”\n\n“The shooting in Alexandria this AM was a senseless horrific act,” Takei tweeted. “My thoughts are with Rep.

I learned at a very young age to identify it.”\n\nThe news was picked up by French media, with mainstream French newspapers reporting on the explosive interview. However, within an hour of publication all reports had been removed from the internet.\n\nFrench newspaper Les Echos’ headline translated into English: “Macaulay Culkin speaks about Hollywood ritual child abuse live on radio”. Les Echos have not responded to questions regarding why they deleted the article within an hour of publication, and if they were pressured to do so.\n\nLes Echo’s report translated into English: “Macaulay Culkin claims Hollywood studio executives rape and murder child stars and use their skin to make boots, belts and wallets that they use as ‘skin trophies’.”\n\nSkin Trophies\n\nDuring the interview, Culkin claimed that children in the entertainment industry “learn very early to recognize which of them want to abuse you, and which of them have even darker tastes,” explaining that some of the Hollywood executives wear “skin trophies”. Explaining that he was 11 the first time he saw human leather, Culkin said he was “filming Home Alone 2 in New York” when he was “ushered into a back room on the set. There was a guy in there, a powerful executive suit type, you know what I mean?”\n\n“He tried to make me relax. Gave me a can of Coke. Started telling me about the nature of the industry. Basically he wanted me to cut my parents out. He wanted to be my guardian. He said he would make me into the biggest teen star in history. He said I had it all. He said I had to get rid of my parents. I was like ‘Dude, I’m 11!’ and he said ‘You’re a man now’.”\n\nCulkin, who has been living in Paris, France since 2003, then explained that the man “began to make his intentions clear”. “He started breathing real shallow. My experience with perverts kicked in. I could tell he was interested in me.\n\nHe licked his lips and told me I was very handsome. I think I managed to say ‘thank you’ and started thinking about how I could get immediately out of there.\n\nThen he reached into his case and took out a crack pipe. He put it in his lap, took out this huge lighter, and continued to gaze at me with this overpowering sexual desire.”\n\n“I was just staring at him. I think I said something like ‘Dude, I’m 11’ again.\n\nI remember he said to me: ‘It’s a celebration, little man. To celebrate your upcoming success. Your many successes. Come. Sit back down’.\n\nHe was tapping the pipe on his crotch, smiling this total creepazoid smile. I ran out of the room, but I ran straight into this other guy who was outside the room and he grabbed me by the arm and threw me back inside.”\n\n“He lit the pipe and blew the smoke in my face. He told me to look at his shoes. He said they were made from the skin of children he and his friends had murdered. He said leather made from human skin is the finest leather known to man.”\n\nDeath of a child star\n\nMacaulay Culkin said the Hollywood executive then dropped a heavy hint about the provenance of the skin used to make his shoes.\n\n“He asked me if I knew Heather O’Rourke. Yeah, I remembered her. I grew up watching Poltergeist. I remembered her in Happy Days. She was so cute. I vomited all over his shoes.”\n\nHeather O’Rourke was an American child actress, discovered by director Steven Spielberg when she was visiting MGM’s studios and later cast as Carol Anne Freeling in the horror film Poltergeist. She had the movie’s most recognizable line: “They’re here!”.\n\nAfter years in the Hollywood system, Heather O’Rourke died suddenly and unexpectedly at the age of 12. The official cause of death was listed as “heart attack and septic shock” caused by a “misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis” in 1988, though many people were left wondering if there was more to the tragic story.\n\n“Let’s just say I went off the rails after my experiences filming Home Alone 2. I’m 37 now and I’m still processing everything. The things I have seen…” Culkin said, before trailing off and abruptly changing the topic.\n\nCulkin’s legacy\n\nThere are a fair few things Macaulay Culkin is remembered for.\n\nPeople like to talk about his years of reported heroin addiction, which snowballed into rumors that he spent an obscene amount of money on drugs. Others chat about his friendship with pop star Michael Jackson, as well as him fronting a pizza-themed comedy rock band.\n\nBut Culkin no longer has the rail thin, sickly appearance of a junkie. Carrying some weight around the midriff, Culkin is looking happier now, and is filming the lead role for friend Seth Green’s vehicle Changeland.\n\nSpeaking about the future, Culkin said “I’ve come out the other side. I’m alive. That is more than can be said for many. I’m not finished yet. Hollywood is going to burn in my lifetime. You watch.”\n\nyogaesoteric\n\nFebruary 25, 2018\n\n",

Kate Middleton and Prince William welcomed their third child on Monday, April 23 at 11:01 a.m. in the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s hospital.\n\nJust like when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stopped for a few quick photos in front of the hospital before they returned to Kensington Palace with their new prince. Duchess Kate wore a red dress with a white lace collar by Jenny Packham, making this the third time she’s worn a bespoke dress by the British designer for her post-birth appearances.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe red dress appeared to be a nod to the outfit Princess Diana wore when she introduced Prince Harry to the world in 1984. Both dresses were bright red with a white Peter Pan collar.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThis wasn't the first time Kate paid homage to her late mother-in-law after giving birth. Kate introduced Prince George to the world in July 2013 wearing a short-sleeved blue dress by Jenny Packham that nodded to the polka-dot dress Princess Diana wore when leaving the hospital with Prince William three decades earlier.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhen Princess Charlotte arrived in May 2015, Duchess Kate opted for another pastel Jenny Packham number, but this time her yellow dress in a buttercup print had longer sleeves to accommodate for the cooler spring weather just like the red dress did today.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPrincess Charlotte also wore a knit cap when she went out into the world for the first time, while Prince George enjoyed the July weather sans-hat on his first outing. Both royal babies were swaddled in a white G.H. Hurt & Son soft wool baby shawl.\n\nThe first public appearances of Prince George (L) and Princess Charlotte (R). Getty Images\n\nSince the weather in London was rather cold and windy today, the new prince also wore a knit cap and what appears to be the same G.H. Hurt & Son baby shawl as his siblings.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe previous two times Duchess Kate stepped out with her newborns she wore light-colored heels, but her Dune sling-back espadrilles were better suited for the July weather than the leather Jimmy Choo pumps she wore to introduce Charlotte.\n\nGetty Images\n\nDuchess Kate went for neutral shoes once again with baby no. 3, opting to re-wear what appears to be her Gianvito Rossi “Gianvito 105” pumps in taupe suede.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPrince George also made an appearance at the hospital when his little sister Charlotte was born, just like his dad Prince William did to greet Prince Harry.\n\nGetty Images\n\nToday, Prince William brought both Prince George and Princess Charlotte to meet their new little brother. This time around George didn’t match with his father, since he came straight from school wearing his uniform. Charlotte, however, was dressed for the occasion in a blue floral Liberty print dress and stole the crowd's heart by showing off her royal wave, while Prince George was a little more shy this time around.\n\nGetty Images",

But I’m not forcing anything right now.”\n\nAs far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well.

And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”\n\nThe pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.\n\nWhen talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other.

        "text": "Honeymoon gone wrong. A lawsuit has been filed against Hollywood producer Joel Silver for the drowning of his assistant, Carmel Musgrove, who was found dead while celebrating Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s honeymoon in 2015.\n\nAccording to the papers obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Silver’s company, Silver Pictures, flew the 28-year-old out to the Four Seasons Hotel in Bora Bora along with others on a chartered Gulfstream to celebrate the marriage of Aniston and Theroux.\n\nOn August 18, 2015, Musgrove reportedly went on a fishing trip and then had dinner with Silver’s family, where alcohol was supplied.\n\nRelated: Happily Wedded Bliss! Celeb Weddings in 2015 Tying the knot in 2015! Check out which celebrities have made the trek down the aisle since January, including Mary-Kate Olsen, Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Aldean, Cameron Diaz, and more.\n\nThe lawsuit — which was filed on Friday, August 18, in L.A. County Superior Court — claims that after dinner, Musgrove went to the bungalow of Silver’s personal chef, Martin Herold, and indulged in cocaine and marijuana before retreating back to her room around 11 p.m. She reportedly sent a message to Herold that said “Xxx” around midnight and asked hotel staff for matches. The staff member who supplied the matches was allegedly the last person to see her alive.\n\nAfter more than a day of searching, her nude body was found floating in a lagoon just 500 yards away from her bungalow.\n\nThe suit questions how an email managed to be sent from her account at 7:04 a.m., if she had died during a midnight swim. It also states that Musgrove’s death was due in part to alcohol, cocaine, work fatigue, heat stroke and swimming in choppy waters.\n\nAfter Musgrove’s death, Silver’s publicist released a statement that said, “Joel Silver, his family and his staff are devastated by the passing of Carmel Musgrove. Carmel was a dear friend and respected colleague with a very bright future ahead of her. They will all miss her dearly.”\n\nThe honeymoon festivities, which were attended by Courteney Cox, Chelsea Handler and Jason Bateman, occurred just one day after Aniston and Theroux tied the knot at their Bel Air mansion. Us Weekly exclusively reported the surprise August 2015 wedding, where other guests included Lisa Kudrow, Howard Stern and Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nRelated: Secret Celebrity Weddings From Ryan Reynolds surprise \"I do\" to Blake Lively to Beyonce's hush-hush ceremony to Jay Z, take a look back in photos at stars who married in secret\n\nSIlver’s company, Silver Pictures, and Herold are also being sued over Musgrove’s death. Silver produced The Matrix, V for Vendetta, and Lethal Weapon, among many other movies.",

        "text": "It's almost meteorological. The funny thing about a backlash is the way it opens things up and builds momentum on its own. It's no coincidence that the metaphors we use for a backlash tend to be come from climactic phenomenon -- an opening of the floodgates, a turning of the tide, when it rains it pours. A backlash, though made by human beings, can feel like a part of the natural world and its inexorable forces. And that seems to be what's happening right now with Taylor Swift.\n\nAnd while there are good things to say about Swift -- her pushing back against streaming services that shaft musicians, for instance -- this tide-turning comes not a moment too soon. I don't say this because I hate Taylor Swift or because I think she's talentless. It's because of the weird consensus that's shaped up around her in the last year or two: That she's a brave young woman who's earned it all herself, that she's \"just like us,\" that she should be lionized for her success at the game of self-branding, that she's a musical genius, that this scion of a multi-generational banking fortune is -- as the New York Times said of her not long ago -- some kind of \"underdog.\"\n\nDespite this weird worship of wealth and power that's grown up in post-Great Recession America -- which has helped Swift immensely -- not everyone loves Swift or her oddly lifeless, machine-made music. But these critical voices have been marginalized. She's like the prom queen who drives the brand-new Mercedes to school, whose parents buy everyone cookies: If you defy her you are some kind of envious grouch or killjoy. Our job is simply to obey.\n\nBut the superstar's Twitter incident with Nicki Minaj -- spurred by MTV's Video Music Awards snubbing Minaj's \"Anaconda\" video -- has opened up a broader discussion about Swift's privilege and preening and phoniness, and it's about time. The Guardian has called Swift's response to Minaj -- she blamed it on men -- \"faux-feminist\" and \"tone deaf.\" The typically sober Atlantic charges Swift with \"uses the pretext of female solidarity to try and shut down [Minaj's] frustration with the music industry.\" (Minaj was complaining about the way black musician often get overlooked.)\n\nAnd the press and media -- which has bowed to Swift's every move -- may be just getting started in this new direction. This is from a substantial new Gawker piece, \"Taylor Swift is Not Your Friend,\" which documents a lot of over-the-top blather praising her.\n\nIt’s surprising to see smart people talk about Swift with such breathlessly positive overtures, not only because—like pop stars before her and pop stars after her—her music is simple and unfussy and infused with inane platitudes, but also because there appears to be something more opportunistic and sinister at play. When Taylor Swift does the mega-pop stardom act, she does it to the tilt. Swift has to be the person with the prettiest friends, the biggest records, the most popular and successful and groanworthily obvious boyfriend. The underdog narrative that the Swift machine has built is one of forced falsehoods; Swift is not coming from behind. She’s been ahead since she started. And watching her collect best friends during a moment in history when womanhood is finally beginning to feel valued does not only feel uncomfortable—it feels evil.\n\nIt's also hard not to find the ultraviolent \"Bad Blood\" video a bit, uh, bloodthirsty, especially given that much of her audience is young girls who may not be legally admitted to PG-13 movies. But Dayna Evans's Gawker piece says the video perfectly illustrates Swift's ruthlessness and feminist posing. \"Swift isn’t here to help women—she’s here to make bank,\" she writes. \"Seeing her on stage cavorting with World Cup winners and supermodels was not a win for feminism, but a win for Taylor Swift. Her plan—to be as famous and as rich as she can possibly be—is working, and by using other women as tools of her self-promotion, she is distilling feminism for her own benefit.\"\n\nSo how far will this go? One thing we've learned lately is that Swift has very smart, savvy people working for her. She's a master of PR, and she could spin this all her way and go back to ordering us mortals to do her laundry and clear her table. But at least for now, we're enjoying a more honest, wide-ranging conversation about a figure who's been coddled for far too long.",

The 27 year-old Harry Potter star has reportedly asked his girlfriend of five years TV and film actress Erin Darke, 28, to marry him, according to Star magazine. Despite denials of an engagement from Daniel’s reps, multiple sources told the mag about the couple’s alleged ring shopping outings. “Daniel recently took Erin ring shopping and spared no expense,” the insider said. “They’ve been talking about marriage for a while now and thought this was something worth splurging on.”\n\n[jwplatform x3lQHDfB]\n\nDaniel reportedly is not one to splurge on major expenses even though he has $97 million at his disposal. He’s practically richer than Gringotts! He and Erin “live a very quiet, ordinary life together in Manhattan,” a source told the mag. The pair have definitely lived their lives fairly under the radar with the exception of a truly impressive karaoke performance! Daniel and Erin were spotted in Half Moon Bay, CA during the summer of 2015 giving their all to a performance of Eminem’s “The Real Slim Shady.” We love these two together! A source described Erin as “an incredibly calming influence on Daniel,” who struggled with alcoholism during his Harry Potter tenure and has been sober for more than three years now.\n\nFans will be waiting longer than a few years for Daniel to don his Hogwarts robes again, but the actor did leave a small chance for his return in the future. “The circumstances would have to be pretty extraordinary. But then I am sure Harrison Ford said that with Han Solo and look what happened there! So I am saying, ‘No,’ for now but leaving room to backtrack in the future,” he told Britain’s Radio Times in June 2016. Wouldn’t that be amazing?\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Daniel is engaged?

Of course, I was like, how could somebody post these pictures of me? I'm like, wow, okay, this is a person I trusted.

But it tuns out these two shared more than just the screen. “Jared and Angelina had a very casual relationship years and years ago, it was a friends with benefits situation,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com\n\nSo, why didn’t they ever get serious? According to our source Jared was just too much of a player. “It might have turned into more but Jared was too noncommittal at the time, he just wasn’t ready to be with one woman, not even Angelina. Then Brad came on the scene and she fell in love and that was that. I know Jared always had regrets about letting her slip away.” Yup, big mistake Jared. Huge.\n\nLuckily for the Suicide Squad hottie he may just be getting another shot with the world’s most beautiful woman. “Jared reached out to Angie after she filed divorce papers in Sep.,” an insider told Star in the magazine’s Feb. 27 issue. “The word is they spoke several times on the phone before meeting up in L.A. for dinner, and they’ve been seeing each other whenever they can since then.” We can totally see these two as a couple.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Jared was a fool for not hanging on to Angelina the first time around? Do you think they’ll get more serious this time? Or will he play her all over again? Let us know in the comments!",

        "text": "Third time may not be the charm for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West! The rapper is reportedly completely ignoring his duties as a new dad in the weeks since the couple’s daughter, Chicago West, was born. Just days after Chicago’s birth, Kanye jetted off to New York for several days, leaving Kim home alone with all three kids, and when he is home, he’s been refusing to change diapers or wake up for late night feedings, according to Star. “Kim let it slide the first time, but she was counting on counting on Kanye to help out around the house because she already has her hands full,” the mag’s insider claims. “Kim was furious when Kanye told her to just hire another nanny. She made it clear that he petter start pulling his weight — or else.”\n\nChicago was born via surrogate on Jan. 15, and is just one of the newest additions to the Kardashian family. On Feb. 1, Kylie Jenner, 20, gave birth to her first child — a baby girl named Stormi Webster. That means Kim and Kylie’s daughters are less than one month apart, and Kim wrote the sweetest message to her little sis about it. “I’m so incredibly proud of the woman you have grown up to be and I know that you are going to be the best mom to your new baby girl!” she gushed. “Our girls are two weeks apart and I can’t wait for them to be besties! I am so proud that you do what you want to do and live your life the way you want you will pass down all of those amazing qualities to your baby girl. You were made to be a mom!”\n\nMeanwhile, Khloe Kardashian is currently pregnant with her first child, and is due at the end of March/beginning of April — so there’ll be another little one added to the mix in just a couple of months!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Kanye will step up as a dad?",

The site also reports that Caitlyn and Sophia are making “secret plans to tie the knot” and that Caitlyn is actually in a rush to get married again after her fallout with the Kardashian sisters.\n\n“Cait has a wedding planner to handle all the details,” Radar’s source claims.”This is a dream come true for Cait because her rejection by the Kardashians had left her feeling isolated. Sophia has changed all that.” The ladies are reportedly planning their nuptials for this summer in Malibu. However, an insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY that reports of an engagement and upcoming wedding for Caitlyn and Sophia are “not true.”\n\nIt’s no secret that Caitlyn and Sophia have a very close relationship, though. Romance rumors first began in 2017, when the women were seen together in Mexico. Recently, they’ve been photographed out and about together quite a bit, although they’ve never confirmed any reports of a romance.\n\nLike Caitlyn, Sophia is a transgender woman. She came out with her decision to transition in a 2016 article in her school newspaper at Pepperdine University. It is rumored that Sophia is living with Caitlyn in Malibu, with those reports fueled by several photos taken in Caitlyn’s home on Sophia’s Instagram page. The women recently attended the Erasing the Stigma Leadership Awards together on April 26, as well as the GLAAD Media Awards earlier that month.",

Vox Media, LLC Terms and Privacy Notice By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\nI am devastated to report that Sofia Richie, 19, broke up with Scott Disick, 35, but the separation only lasted for two days. There have been a lot of conflicting reports about the state of the couple’s tortured relationship in the last week, but I trust the Kardashians’ official news network, E!, to have the most honest version of events.\n\nE! reported yesterday that Richie ended things with Disick after he was spotted getting handsy with a “mystery blonde” at Kanye West’s album release party in Wyoming. (It’s interesting that Richie, who has been dating Disick for over a year — my God — wasn’t invited to the release party in the first place. I think that shows the Kardashians still have a long way to go in terms of accepting the relationship.) The breakup, however, lasted just 48 hours, as Disick quickly won Richie back with promises to “change.”\n\nAccording to E!, Richie has been living at Disick’s house in L.A., but she stayed at her father Lionel Richie’s house during the short separation. “Lionel and her family encouraged the split and are very upset and disappointed that she decided to get back with him,” a source told the site.\n\nUs Weekly reported last week that Lionel threatened to cut Sofia out of his will if she continued her relationship with Disick. But Sofia seems committed: She referred to Disick as her “whole [heart emoji]” on Instagram yesterday. Please pray that all relevant parties see reason soon.\n\nKendall Jenner, who once comically referred to Richie as one of Disick’s children, kissed someone in public. That someone is Anwar Hadid, the 18-year-old model brother of Jenner’s friends Gigi and Bella Hadid. TMZ got a photo of the pair making out at an after-party for the CFDAs Monday night. According to the gossip site, “Kendall was hangin’ with Anwar at Socialista New York for about 2 hours — kissing, cuddling and drinking with the youngest Hadid sibling the whole time.”\n\nWill Gigi and Bella be upset? Who cares! Jenner never does anything fun, and this sounds fun. She also never shows PDA with anyone she reportedly dates. (Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, A$AP Rocky …) Maybe Anwar is the one.\n\nGigi Hadid, meanwhile, looks to be back together with her ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik. And Bella has been spotted hanging out several times with her ex-boyfriend the Weeknd. Everyone is happy.\n\nIn other new celeb relationship news, Jennifer Lawrence reportedly has a new boyfriend. According to “Page Six,” his name is Cooke Maroney, and he is a director at New York’s Gladstone Gallery. A source told the gossip site, “They met through Jen’s friend Laura … The relationship has been going on a few weeks. But they have been very private and careful not to be seen together.” This is exactly the thing a “source” would say before a new couple is about to be seen together. Keep your eyes on the Daily Mail!\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n“Page Six” says that Maroney is 33, which is great. It’s a nice age for a boyfriend to be, when you’re 27, which Lawrence is. A terrible age for a boyfriend to be is: 49.\n\nOne Small Blessing\n\n“Audrina Patridge is the happiest she’s ever been since reuniting with Ryan Cabrera.”\n\nBlind Item of the Week\n\nAnd here’s an interesting blind item from this week, care of Enty at the best site for blind items, Crazy Days and Nights:\n\n“I don’t think he acts enough any longer to be permanently A or A- list, but this former A+ list mostly movie actor cheated on his wife the night before they got married. He called it a cleanse. Uh huh.”\n\nWho could it be? Richard Gere recently got married. So did Hugh Grant. Put your guess in the comments or speak it to the wind!\n\nFinally, I’ll leave you with this photo of Emma Stone and Justin Theroux “hanging out” in a bungalow at the Hotel du Cap Eden Roc in the south of France last week. Both stars, who have been rumored to be dating since they left Rihanna’s Met Gala after-party together, were in town for the Louis Vuitton cruise show. Stone told reporters Theroux was like her “brother” at the show. Does this look like a brother-sister relationship to you? Let me know!\n\nPhoto: SAUD/One Shot / BACKGRID\n\nThanks so much for gossiping this week.

        "text": "View gallery\n\nTom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, “Reputation“. But, come on, Tom; anyone’s fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks — “I Did Something Bad” and “Getaway Car”. And, since the pair didn’t split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he would’ve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.\n\n“Tom was not expecting to be a part of Taylor’s album,” a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He thought they were on good terms,” our insider says, adding, “After their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no. But everyone’s saying she did and he’s stunned. He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.” Well, maybe next time, Tom.\n\nAs soon as Taylor’s sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, here’s what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, “I Did Something Bad”, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a “narcissist” who “talks sh-t.” Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a “playboy” who she flew “around the world” with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.\n\nThe second Tom reference on “Reputation” came on the track, “Getaway Car”, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn’t have a “reason.” Then, when she goes to an event where “the ties were black and the lights were white,” she found her reason — a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala… the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn’t work out, and that the person [Tom] should’ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.\n\nTaylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogue‘s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.\n\nHollywoodLifers, tell us, do you love Taylor’s new album?",

        "text": "The Kardashian family feud raged on as the sisters disagreed about who should be invited to momager Kris Jenner‘s Christmas Eve party.\n\nOn Sunday night’s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, things were still tense between Kim and Khloé and eldest sibling Kourtney.\n\n“We really haven’t resolved anything with Kourtney since the therapy sessions. We have so much more to hash out,” Kim told the camera, adding that she felt like they were all “walking on egg shells.”\n\nMaking things worse? Kourtney didn’t want Scott Disick, the father of her three children, invited to Kris’ annual blowout — because then-boyfriend Younes Bendjima would be there.\n\n“He’s still part of our family,” Kris insisted.\n\n“What about my dad?” Kendall Jenner interjected, referring to Caitlyn Jenner, who’d fallen out with Kris and the Kardashian girls following the publication of her explosive memoir.\n\n“Nobody thats coming would even know how to respond to her,” Kris argued, adding that she has a friendly relationship with Scott and wanted him present.\n\n“Oh, you didn’t have a relationship with my dad for 25 years?” Kendall asked angrily.\n\nBut Kim and Khloé were on Scott’s side.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim and Khloé Kardashian Attend Sister Therapy with Kourtney After Calling Her a ‘Raging Bitch’\n\n“I don’t care that Kourtney has a boyfriend. I have a girlfriend. i don’t give a s—,” he told them later. (He’s been dating Sofia Richie since the fall.)\n\nMeanwhile, Kourtney found an ally in Kendall.\n\n“It should be Younes going to the party and Scott coming to Christmas morning,” Kendall said, adding that it “blew my mind” how her mom and sisters didn’t recognize that banning Caitlyn yet welcoming Scott was hypocritical.\n\n“Why is Scott coming to the party more important than my feelings?” Kourtney asked, mentioning that she was considering taking her kids out of town for the holiday to avoid drama.\n\n“That’s not okay,” Khloé said when Kendall relayed the news.\n\n“Do you think that’s like a cry for help, a cry for attention? Is she the new Rob?” Kim asked.\n\nKourtney brought Kendall to an ice-skating trip with her kids, and they discussed the rift further.\n\n“You have to spend Christmas with us,” Kendall said.\n\n“I just don’t know if we’re going to get along if we’re all in the same place,” Kourtney replied. “The meanness and stuff, it’s not worth it.”\n\nLuckily, Kendall convinced her to stick around Calabasas. “I think you guys should make up and not worry about it, because it’s the holidays,” she said\n\nAnd when Kourtney realized she wanted her kids to be around their cousins and aunts, she agreed.\n\nSo, she decided to talk to Scott directly about her concerns.\n\n“I heard through the grapevine you’re the one person who doesn’t want me to go,” he said.\n\n“I think that our lives are changing,” she said. “If my boyfriend is going to the party, if you’re there, I just don’t want any disrespect. I’ve been feeling super anxious … but I don’t want the kids to not have their dad there.”\n\nIn the end, Scott and Younes both attended, and even Caitlyn was invited, though she skipped out on the festivities.\n\n“Not sharing this whole experience with my family and my kids, it wouldn’t have felt right,” Kourtney concluded, adding that getting in the Christmas spirit helped her resolve her issues with her sisters.",

Kim, who has daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 18 months, with Kanye, is desperate to give her kids another sibling. As for Kanye… “He doesn’t want a third child,” the source admits, “but Kim thinks she’s found a way around that.”\n\nThe 36-year-old has been searching for a surrogate to carry their frozen embryo. “She wants to choose someone outside of the state of California, where there are all kinds of surrogacy laws,” the source says. “She’s ready to go.”\n\nKim previously revealed that it would be extremely dangerous for her to get pregnant again, given the complications she experienced during her last two deliveries. “Not only has this been really painful, but now hearing that I can’t carry any more kids, it couldn’t get any worse,” she said on an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nMORE: Kim Kardashian Is Coming for Sister Kylie Jenner With a Beauty Line of Her Own!\n\nHere’s hoping the couple will be able to set aside their differences.\n\nFor more updates on Kimye’s relationship, pick up the latest issue of Life & Style, on newsstands now.

        "text": "The women at the Cannes Film Festival made their voices heard at an extraordinary protest on the red carpet on Saturday evening, with Cate Blanchett, Kristen Stewart, Jane Fonda and Ava DuVernay among a group of 82 women standing in silent vigil ahead of a premiere at the Croisette.\n\nBlanchett and French director Agnes Varda gave impassioned speeches in English and French, respectively.\n\n“As women, we all face our own unique challenges, but we stand together on these stairs today as a symbol of our determination and commitment to progress,” read Blanchett and Varda’s statement.\n\n“We will expect our institutions to actively provide parity and transparency in their executive bodies and safe environments in which to work. We will expect our governments to make sure that the laws of equal pay for equal work are upheld. We will demand that our workplaces are diverse and equitable so that they can best reflect the world in which we actually live. A world that allows all of us behind and in front of the camera to thrive shoulder to shoulder with our male colleagues.”\n\nMoment historique de ce 71e @Festival_Cannes la “Montée des Femmes”. 82 Femmes du cinéma réunies sur les marches #Cannes2018 #Féminisme pic.twitter.com/aTO6sjekp2 – Citizen Cannes TV (@CITIZENCANNES) May 12, 2018\n\n“We acknowledge all of the women and men who are standing for change. The stairs of our industry MUST be accessible to all. Let’s climb.”\n\nVarda is one of only two women in Cannes Film Festival’s history to receive the Palme d’Or — the highest prize awarded — along with New Zealand filmmaker Jane Champion.\n\nThe group stood on the steps of the Palais des Festival silently to protest how hard it still is to climb the ladder as a woman in Hollywood. The protests, part of the rising 5050×2020 movement was planned ahead of the premiere of “Girls of the Sun,” a film in competition by director Eva Husson, one of only three female filmmakers in the running.\n\nThat is an improvement over Cannes’ historical record. Only 82 films in official selection in the history of the Cannes Film Festival have been directed by women. The number of women participating in the protest was selected to match this figure.\n\nOthers involved in the vigil are Salma Hayek, Marion Cotillard, director Patty Jenkins and Haifaa al-Mansour, and agents including CAA’s Hylda Queally and activist-journalist Melissa Silverstein.\n\nDuVernay and Stewart are on the jury. Fonda is at the festival for the screening of a documentary about her life.\n\nSilverstein told TheWrap that the protest originated with the French group Le Deuxieme Regard and the 5050×2020 collective, working directly with the festival.\n\n“They get all the credit,” said Silverstein. “I am honored to work with them to amplify the message about the need for more women in the competition at the festival. This feels like a very big moment.”\n\nOn the 5050×2020 website, the organization released a statement echoing many of those given by women involved in the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements in Hollywood, noting how the downfall of producer Harvey Weinstein has triggered a demand for change and calling for the French film industry to confront that demand.\n\n“While French cinema wasn’t shaken by the Weinstein shock wave, it is essential that we move to take concrete action reaching beyond the issue of sexual abuse alone,” the site’s statement reads.\n\n“We believe that the distribution of power needs to be questioned. We believe that equality restores the balance of power. We believe that diversity deeply changes representations. We believe that the opportunity to work in an egalitarian and inclusive environment must be seized because we are certain that the equal sharing of power will promote profound creative renewal.”\n\nAs TheWrap reported recently, the statistics for women in Cannes are pretty dismal: Over the first 71 years, a paltry 4.3 percent of the competition films have been directed by women. (See chart below.) Only one, Jane Campion’s “The Piano,” has won the Palme d’Or, though actresses Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux were given honorary Palmes alongside “Blue Is the Warmest Color” director Abdellatif Kechiche’s real one in 2013.\n\nAdmittedly, things are getting better. Of the 11 times that three or more women have placed films in competition, eight have come in the last 13 years. Three women made the cut in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 — and four did so in 2011.\n\nThis year along with Husson, the women in competition include Nadine Labaki with “Capharnaum” and Alice Rohrwacher with “Happy as Lazzaro.”",

        "text": "Brad Pitt is balancing work with fatherhood.\n\nThe 54-year-old actor was snapped on the Los Angeles set of his new film with Leonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, on Monday, rocking a denim-on-denim outfit. A source tells ET that Pitt has been busy filming the highly anticipated Quentin Tarantino crime drama set in 1969, but also spending time with his kids.\n\nAccording to the source, Pitt's kids with estranged wife Angelina Jolie have been spending time with the actor at his Los Feliz, California, home, and that there's \"a lot of laughter and skating\" around the house.\n\nBG010/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images\n\nBG010/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images\n\nBG010/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images\n\nLast month, Pitt and 43-year-old Jolie struck a new custody agreement when it comes to their six children. According to court documents obtained by ET, Jolie was ordered by a judge to help repair her children's relationship with Pitt. A judge determined that the kids \"not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,\" and the actor will now have more time with his minor children -- 14-year-old Pax, 13-year-old Zahara, 12-year-old Shiloh and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne -- over the summer, while 16-year-old Maddox, \"because of his age and maturity,\" can determine how much time he wants to spend with his father.\n\nIn keeping with the new custody agreement, Pitt has been with the children since July 21 and will have them through July 29, before he is responsible for getting the kids back to London to be with Jolie. Pitt must arrange for visits with doctors and a therapist during his time with the kids, while Jolie is only allowed to call the kids once per day at a time agreed in advance by both parents.\n\nLate last month, a source told ET that Pitt is looking to improve his co-parenting relationship with Jolie, and is choosing fatherhood over dating.\n\n\"Brad was taking time to date, when he had the time. He also enjoyed quietly dating,\" the source said. \"But now all he wants to do is focus on family. He has taken a step away from dating because of the importance of his children and also to help mend fences with Angelina.\"\n\n\"[He and Angelina] still don't get along at all, and in fact, they can barely be in the same room,\" the source added. \"Brad doesn't want to rock the boat [by dating]. He wants to try to co-parent and the last thing he needs right now is to start another war because things seem smoother than they've ever been.\"\n\nFor more on Pitt and Jolie's current relationship, watch the video below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:",

        "text": "President Donald Trump has broken his silence on the James Comey hearing, declaring that the nearly three hours of Senate testimony from the former FBI director on Thursday amounted to “total and complete vindication” of his actions after winning the election in November.\n\nTrump sent a tweet at 6:10 a.m. ET that also criticized Comey for his admission that he leaked information to the media via an intermediary in an effort to force the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of collusion during the 2016 election cycle between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials. Comey’s gambit worked as another former FBI director, Robert Mueller, was named last month as a special counsel to the Justice Department to lead an independent probe.\n\nThere had been speculation that President Trump would offer his commentary on Comey’s testimony in real time on Twitter, but he waited until early Friday morning to weigh in.\n\n“Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker!” the President wrote.\n\nDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2017\n\nThursday’s hearing transfixed much of the nation as Comey answered questions from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee about his dealings with Trump and his assertion that Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to Russian officials. The Senate is investigating the broader question of Russian interference in the U.S. election. Trump and his associates have strongly denied there was any such collusion.\n\nComey, who was fired by Trump on May 9, repeatedly stated that Trump has lied in his accounts of their interactions. He blasted the President and members of his administration for what he described as a campaign to “defame” him and the FBI. Comey also asserted there was no doubt that the Russian government directed a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 election through hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s email system as well as through other cyber-malfeasance.\n\n“There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever, the Russians interfered in our election,” Comey said.\n\nThe Comey has hearing generated a tidal wave of media coverage and analysis that will undoubtedly continue for many days. About 45 minutes after his tweet about the hearing, Trump sent another message praising Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” morning show, which is known to be among his favorite news programs.",

        "text": "In the aftermath of Justin Bieber’s quickie engagement to Hailey Baldwin, and his light-on-the-punctuation celebratory Instagram on the matter, all eyes seemed to turn expectantly to Selena Gomez and collectively ask in a sing-songy voice: “Are you okay?” This is only natural, given that she is one-half of the couple formerly known as Jelena, and had dated Bieber on and off since 2010—back when he used to have a bowl cut and wear his favorite color, purple, all the time. The concern was especially palpable since Bieber and Gomez had been together as recently as a few months ago, only reportedly breaking up in March.\n\nHowever, as much as the tabloid-consuming public loves a love triangle and salivates over the idea of a woman scorned, I’m going to go out on a limb and say that if there’s anyone we should be worried about right now, it would not be Selena Gomez. Beliebers may not be fine—whether because they wanted to marry Bieber themselves or because they longed for Bieber and Gomez to end up together at last—but something tells me Selena Gomez is more than fine herself. And not just because she stepped out looking perfectly happy in new hair extensions this week or because a source bluntly told Us Weekly: “Selena doesn’t care.”\n\nFor one, Gomez was always the more mature, has-her-shit-together member of the relationship. She was never the one getting arrested for a DUI in a rented Lamborghini in Miami. She has never urinated in a restaurant mop bucket. She has, especially by child Disney star–turned–teen pop idol standards, largely skirted controversy and scandal. And perhaps she is not the spontaneous, splashy engagement type either, which may be why she is no longer with someone who clearly is. All good thoughts to Bieber and Baldwin, but statistically speaking, drawing on the history of young celebrity engagements, Gomez is probably not the person we should be concerned about here.\n\nFurthermore, for Selena Gomez, marrying Justin Bieber could very possibly feel akin to marrying your high school boyfriend at age 25, which a lot of people, in 2018, simply do not want to do. The long—so long—history of their relationship was absolutely part of what made people root for them, but it could always be a valid deal-breaker. “It was never a healthy situation for Selena and Justin,” a source tells People. A “Bieber pal” echoed to the magazine: “Their relationship was always very complex and complicated. It was just too much baggage.”",

        "text": "Alexandra Daddario, 32, wants to make something very clear: She’s not dating Zac Efron. Yes, he was her love interest in the 2017 Baywatch film but the actress claims that, in real life, they’re just “good friends.” Alexandra clarified their relationship in an interview with PEOPLE. Crushing the hopes of Baywatch fans everywhere, she said on May 31, “We’re very good friends. Zac and I’ve worked together, and we’re very good friends.”\n\nIt’s not the first time that Alexandra has claimed that Zac, 30, is in the friendship zone. In May 2017, she told E! News, “We work together closely; he’s my love interest in the film. I understand why people would go crazy over something like that, but Zac and I are very good friends.” So, what happened? Alexandra’s comments don’t match what HollywoodLife and other outlets have been told about the status of her relationship with Zac. In April a source EXCLUSIVELY told us that the actress has been “very coy” about their rumored romance. The person added, “But people that are close to her know that this a defense mechanism because she really wants it to work and doesn’t want anything to get in the way of a great love match. She wants to make it look like she is single in public but is 100 percent all about Zac and the relationship they are brewing.”\n\nIf we take Alexandra at her word, she and Zac have definitely – at the very least – formed their own mutual admiration society. On March 16, he posted a tribute to the actress on his Instagram page. Next to a photo of them together, he wished her a “Happy Birthday” calling her the, “most real, down to earth, stunning, intelligent, creative, loving and most rare Pokemon ever created.” And on April 4, when Alexandra posted a photo of her looking at her dog on Instagram, he commented, “Two hot b*tches.” Because, with flirting like that, of course people wouldn’t think they’re dating. Right?",

        "text": "It's been a busy few months for the Kardashian/Jenner family. With pregnancy rumors a-swirling and just about every sister involved romantically with somebody, it was only a matter of time before Kendall Jenner jumped into a new relationship. People are wondering how Kendall Jenner and Blake Griffin met, and it's like... I don't know, you guys. How does ANYONE meet a famous supermodel and reality TV star and/or professional athlete? My guess is someone's \"people\" called the other person's \"people\" and set up a lunch date like I've read about in old-timey novels, but then again, I'm not famous. I literally have no idea how things work.\n\nAll I know is Jenner has been to at least four basketball games to catch Griffin play with his team, the Los Angeles Clippers, and they've had a few dinners together. If that doesn't shout \"MAYBE THEY'RE BECOMING A 'THING'\" I literally don't know what else does.\n\nJenner and Griffin were first linked together back in September of 2017 when they went out for dinner in New York City. The two dined at a spot called Carbone (bone... hehehe) and reportedly saw the movie It. I mean, a swanky Italian dinner followed by a scary movie? Sounds like a good ol' fashioned high school date night to me. Since then, Jenner has been regularly attending his games and even celebrated her 22nd birthday with him.\n\nE! reports that Jenner partied on her big day with family and friends at a taqueria in Los Angeles and that she and Griffin arrived separately. Still, an insider says the two spent the entire evening together. The source added, \"They weren't overly affectionate, but they spent a lot of time talking closely and dancing.\"\n\nMaybe that's because most of Jenner's family was there, including family matriarch Kris Jenner, Corey Gamble, Kim and Kanye West, and Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nAnother source told People magazine that they started dating casually, but now things are picking up. The source said,\n\nKendall is very happy with Blake. They started out more like friends, and then it was very casual. But it seems more serious lately. When they are not together, they keep in touch over the phone. Her family has accepted Blake. They are spending time getting to know him.\n\nYet another insider told US Weekly that the pair is \"full on,\" claiming,\n\nThey’re legit. They’re a full-on couple. Kendall has been going to a lot of his games and they have been enjoying time at home when Blake is in town. They’re good.\n\nNot for nothing, Griffin sounds like a pretty awesome guy. While he was once named One Of The Greatest Rookies Of All Time by Sports Illustrated, you might have also caught him flexing some comedy chops on the hit series Broad City. Griffin has somewhat of an affinity for comedy, and has even performed at Montreal's mega-comedy festival Just For Laughs. He also co-parents two kids, ages one and four, with his ex, Brynn Cameron, which Griffin says has changed a lot for him.\n\nHe told the Los Angeles Times,\n\nNow it’s like what kind of example am I leaving or setting for my son... When my daughter can actually know what’s going on? What type of example am I showing her about how she should expect to be treated by men and all those things...\n\nHe added, \"Like, that’s the biggest thing … I spend my time a little different and I think a little differently.\"\n\nSpend your time a little different like... hanging out with Kendall Jenner all the time? We totally get it.\n\nCheck out the entire Gen Why series and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.",

In fact, they try to ignore it completely.\n\n“I was at a newsstand … and there was a cover of Brad [Pitt] and Jen [Aniston],” she recalled. “I literally just stared at it, and I was like, ‘They haven’t seen each other. … How is this even a thing? I know for a fact.’ … I actually took a picture of it and sent it to Ellen and said, ‘Can you believe this?’ Anyway, no, in other words, we avoid it. We don’t care.”\n\nRelated: Celebrity LGBT Allies In honor of Gay Pride Month, see which stars support marriage equality\n\nDe Rossi also spoke with Us about launching The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund in honor of her wife’s birthday in January. “All of it was a complete surprise, which was very difficult. It was so difficult to keep it from her,” she said. “She’s so observant. I literally had to take my email address off all of our shared devices at home … because I knew that if she saw an email coming in from Africa, it would be all over. She would put it all together.”\n\nThe philanthropist explained that she wanted to do something special for the TV host’s milestone day. “I thought this was a big birthday, 60, and she’s not going to do her talk show forever, and I want her to be able to look forward to retiring, to know that there was something the entertainment industry that she could sink her teeth into,” she told Us. “It was those two things.”\n\nRelated: Celebrity Couples Who Prove Love Isn’t Dead In light of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s headline-making split on Tuesday, September 20, Us Weekly rounded up some of Hollywood’s hottest celebrity couples who prove that love isn’t dead — see who made the cut!\n\nIn addition, de Rossi opened up about how her company, General Public, partnered with Restoration Hardware. “I’m an art lover and collector. I wouldn’t call myself an expert, I’m just a fan,” she said. “I saw the disparity between the quality of art that you can get in the fine art market and decorative art that is available to most people. I just thought that it was kind of a shame that you have to be extremely interested in art — or interested enough to go to an art gallery or learn the art market — in order to get a better quality of art than what is available. I really wanted to bridge the gap a little and just introduce more artists into this kind of vortex in between and really support them because most of the art that you see that’s available at retail is made by graphic designers or computer generated. I wanted actual artists to be able to share their work.”",

As RadarOnline.com has reported, in the past week, legal papers have shown that Jolie, 43, accused Pitt, 54, of not paying her enough child support over the past two years.",

        "text": "Everyone is always talking about Kim Kardashian. Whether she's supporting Kanye West in his latest debacle or sharing pictures of her cute kids, the woman and her family make their rounds on the internet. This time, the brave reality star shared a shocking video of herself in complete disarray. The video of Kim Kardashian having a panic attack is frightening and heartbreaking, but nonetheless, honest and brave because she allowed camera crews to document it.\n\nAccording to a report from BuzzFeed, in an upcoming episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim K arrives at a house in Mexico with several of her close friends and grows increasingly more uncomfortable and anxious. She begins having severe flashbacks of her Paris robbery incident, and the post traumatic stress sets in. Kim K called her friend and the owner of the house, Joe Francis, hysterically crying, saying, \"Are you sure it's safe here? ... I’m just like, why did I come, you know?\"\n\nOn the other line, her friend reassures her. \"Yeah, I promise you. Look, I went through the same thing and I promise you, it's safe. I have my kids there.\"\n\nKim explains the traumatic ordeal in a confessional interview on KUWTK,\n\nEver since Paris, I just go through this worst-case scenario mode in my head. I was so excited to come on this trip and I had no idea that I was gonna end up feeling this way.\n\nKim K also explained,\n\nBut it hit me right as we were getting off the plane that all of these people at the airport are going to see you know, 17 or 18 girls with all of our Chanel bags and Louis Vuitton this, and it just like hit me: We’re the biggest target ever.\"\n\nSince Kim K's robbery in Paris back in 2016, the reality star has shared her battle with anxiety and her struggles from it. She told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview from April of 2017 that she has sleeping issues at night, unless there's a security guard outside of her door and present at her residence. She said,\n\nMy whole life has changed. I never thought I would need security staying outside of my door. I should have had a security guard outside of my door. Now I have several just for me to be able to sleep at night.\n\nBack in April, Kim K suffered another bout with anxiety on an episode of KUWTK. The business mogul decided to finally leave the house to attend a Kanye West concert, but within minutes suffered from a panic attack. She began having terrible anxiety and had to rush out of the auditorium. She said in a confessional on the show,\n\nI just want to disappear for a little bit. I have to do what makes me feel comfortable.\n\nKim K was robbed at gunpoint by two masked men in her hotel room in Paris in October of 2016. The men reportedly stole $10 million dollars worth of jewelry and tied up the Kardashian star. She was unharmed, but severely shaken.\n\nAlthough the entire Kardashian family is severely judged by every move they make, it's important to remember they are human, too. Kim K appears to have it all together on the outside, but on the inside she's just like the millions of other people who suffer from panic attacks and anxiety disorders daily. Those who go through it know how deeply traumatic it can feel. That's why Kim's brave documentation of her anxiety attack is important to showcase and to remember. It's proof we all struggle... even Kim Kardashian.\n\nCheck out the entire Gen Why series and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.",

I will never be able to repay her for the blessings that she gave me.”\n\nIn a statement to EW, Moore’s costar from 1967’s Thoroughly Modern Millie, Julie Andrews, called her a “very dear friend.”\n\n“We bonded instantly on the film,” Andrews said, “and laughed our way through the production. Ever since that time, we never referred to each other again as Julie and Mary. Whenever we bumped into each other, people must have thought us nuts…screaming across some shopping aisle in a supermarket or yelling to each other down the corridors of CBS…’Millie! Miss Dorothy!'”\n\n“She was a joy to work with, her talent was monumental. She was brave, kind, generous and an activist for many causes,” Andrews continued. “I will miss my ‘Miss Dorothy’ so much, but I’m comforted to know that the joy she brought us all will be everpresent in her many films and television shows.”\n\nMoore’s friend Larry King also expressed his condolences, tweeting, “Mary Tyler Moore was a dear friend and a truly great person. A fighter. Rest in peace, MTM.”\n\nSee more reactions below.",

Gomez, she said, told her over FaceTime she was a match.\n\n“And I’m like, ‘Yay... what? How do you know this?’” the “Grown-ish” actress said. “I had a way that I wanted to tell her when I made the decision. I knew it was gonna happen, I just needed that time, like it’s a big thing.”\n\nShe continued, “So I hang up, and I call my social worker, and I’m angry. And she told me, ‘It’s gonna be hard: the recipient is gonna glow, and she’s gonna recover a lot faster than the donor is ‘cause she’s receiving something she needs. You’re losing something you don’t need to lose. It’s gonna be hard.’ And it was very hard. Selena and I both went through a depression.”\n\nSELENA GOMEZ IS TAKING A BREAK FROM FAME AFTER JUSTIN BIEBER BREAKUP, REPORT SAYS\n\nGomez, according to Raisa, “had some complications with hers, and she’s bigger scars, than you know, I do.”\n\nRaisa said that Gomez texted her, “I’m so scared I might die.”\n\n“I was like, 'What?' And I - I was calling someone and that’s when when she got the complication where the kidney turned and broke an artery,” Raisa revealed. “And she had to go back in and they actually had to take a vein out of her leg, so she has a scar right here, and um, build a wall around her artery.”\n\nGomez also opened up about her battle with depression in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in early February.\n\n\"[Depression is] not something I feel I’ll ever overcome,\" Gomez told the magazine. \"There won’t be a day when I’m like, 'Here I am in a pretty dress— I won!' I think it’s a battle I’m gonna have to face for the rest of my life, and I’m okay with that because I know that I’m choosing myself over anything else.\"\n\nThe singer has been very open about her life-saving transplant.\n\n“As soon as I got the kidney transplant, my arthritis went away,” the singer told TODAY in October. “My lupus -- there’s about a 3-5 percent chance it'll ever come back. My blood pressure is better. My energy, my life has been better.”\n\nGomez praised Raisa during an acceptance speech for the Billboard Woman of the Year Award in November 2017.\n\n\"I think Francia should be getting this award. She saved my life … I feel incredibly lucky,” she said at the time.",

The Duchess of Cambridge is said forbidding him from solo travel as she's allegedly furious after seeing all pictures and videos that emerged from the ski trip.\n\nNational Enquirer is the first to claim that Kate refuses to let William travel alone, blaring an alarming headline, \"Kate Puts Wild William On A Short Leash.\" The publication goes on citing a so-called source as saying, \"Kate was furious when she saw the pictures. These boys-only skiing trips are a thing of the past.\"\n\n\"Kate wears the trousers in their marriage,\" the alleged insider further purports, before adding that the mother of 3-year-old George and 1-year-old Charlotte found her husband's behavior \"humiliating and William will be made to pay.\"\n\nNo Kensington Palace reps have responded to the news. As reported before, Prince William skipped a Commonwealth Day service to enjoy a lads-only holiday. He was partying with his pals Guy Pelly, James Meade and Tom van Straubenzee at a club in Verbier, Switzerland on Monday, March 13.\n\nThe second in line to the throne in England was rumored cheating on his wife Kate after he was spotted \"having a cozy lunch\" with Aussie-born model Sophie Taylor during the ski trip. The two were reportedly drinking beer, wine and Jagerbombs at the Verbier resort. They were also pictured high-fiving.\n\nYou can share this post!",

        "text": "Getty\n\nMany celebrities have been sharing their thoughts on Hurricane Irma, which is expected to cause extensive damage to Florida after wreaking havoc in the Caribbean.\n\nLast night, \"Extra's\" AJ Calloway caught up with Rihanna, who expressed sadness over Hurricane Irma. She said, \"My family is safe, Barbados is very safe right now. It breaks my heart to see what is happening in the rest of the Caribbean, my neighboring islands. You feel helpless when it's a natural disaster. You have no control and these are islands that I have been to and love… it's so sad.”\n\nWhile attending a show at New York Fashion Week, Heidi Klum told “Extra” on Thursday, \"It is horrible what is happening. I hope that everyone will be safe. People are evacuating. I have some friends in Miami, I know that they are leaving right now… it's devastating.”\n\nEarlier this week, Emmy Rossum said at a PaleyFest TV Preview event, “It's upsetting, especially coming on the heels of Harvey. Some of us continue to deny that climate change is a real thing and I think that is very dangerous.”\n\n\"Good Morning America\" anchor Amy Robach made a trip to Miami International Airport, which was \"virtually empty.\" While many were able to make it out of Miami, thousands of others have been misplaced. She told \"Extra\" on Friday, \"Airport officials have been shuttling people on buses to local shelters to ride out Irma when it makes landfall.\" Watch.\n\nSee more celebrity reactions to Hurricane Irma below.\n\nIslands of the Caribe, stay safe. Your children all over the world are praying for you. #Irma @Lin_Manuel\n\nMy prayers for my beloved Puerto Rico and all the areas that can be affected by Hurricane Irma. God bless you all always! #FuerzaMiGente @MarcAnthony\n\nPrayers are sent and I pray everyone is safe. Support will be needed to rebuild and we will be there. https://t.co/nc0apJD1cL @HereIsGina\n\nI'm currently in Ft. Lauderdale FL, evacuating tomorrow morning-\n\nIf ur in an evac zone- don't wait this out. Get inland asap. #Irma2017 @IMKristenBell",

We want to be able to communicate and have conversations with the kids while eating together—so we try not to have TV or iPads out during breakfast, lunch or dinner.\"\n\nAt night, the family usually cuddles up and watches a movie before their bedtime routine, which includes reading books together.\"[We] never have iPads during this time (which the kids don't even miss, since they love our reading routine).\"\n\nKourtney also notes that she tries to come up with creative activities for her kids. \"Every family is different, but these rules work for us!\" she explains.\n\nOne of those many creative activities includes having Penelope star in her own YouTube-like tutorials. The eldest Kardashian recently shared two clips of her little girl teaching people how to make slime.\n\nWATCH: North West and Penelope Disick Celebrate Joint 'Moana'-Themed Birthday Bash: See the Adorable Pics!\n\nThe Kardashian family also seems to have a rule when it comes to cursing.

        "text": "Chelsea Handler has reportedly ditched her friendship with Jennifer Aniston to forge a relationship with Brad Pitt, proving once and for all that celebrity friendships in Hollywood are little more than smoke and mirrors. Chelsea Handler and Jennifer Aniston were long time BFFs and did everything that best friends would do, including hate each others ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands, and ex-husbands’ new partners.\n\nIn fact, Handler has been especially vitriolic towards Angelina Jolie in the past, publicly speaking out against Jolie for ‘stealing’ Brad Pitt away from Jennifer Aniston. Yes, it takes two people to break up a marriage, but Handler always reserved her vitriol for Angelina Jolie, much like the rest of Jennifer Aniston’s close-knit BFF crew (albeit none as vocally as Chelsea Handler).\n\nHowever, Chelsea and Jennifer have allegedly had a falling out recently, as they’ve barely spent any time together and are clearly (and visibly) on the outs with each other. Some reports claim that this is because Chelsea has been spilling secrets about Jennifer’s marriage to Justin Theroux, and others claim that it was just them naturally growing apart. Regardless, Chelsea’s already gone as far as to find a new BFF in Charlize Theron, and Jennifer? Well, she’s busy with her new husband and working hard to reboot her TV career.\n\nAs this has all been happening, a new report from Radar Online claims that Chelsea has been in the process of replacing her friendship with Jennifer Aniston with another relationship – this time with Jennifer’s ex, Brad Pitt! Radar’s source explains, “Chelsea never hated Brad for what he did to Jennifer; she always blamed Angelina Jolie for the nasty split. But now that she isn’t friends with Jen, Chelsea is free to work with Brad. Chelsea has long been a fan of Brad’s Plan B production company and is talking with them about a few projects.”\n\nPlan B is one of the most prolific production companies in town, and has won several Oscars over the past few years. As such, any working actor or actress would jump at the chance to work with them, ex-best friends and ex-grudges aside. It’s likely that Chelsea Handler cozying up to Brad Pitt has little to do with getting back at Jennifer Aniston for cutting off their friendship, and more to do with her own career movement.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Will Chelsea Handler forget all about her ex-best friend Jennifer Aniston to work with Jennifer’s ex-husband and the man that she spent years dumping on, Brad Pitt? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",

But I'm a mom, I'm busy and we forget to put a little bit into ourselves. Even one minute, 30 seconds can just sort of boost yourself, and it's important to remember to take that time to do that,\" Barrymore said.\n\nAs for the planned reboot of Charlie's Angels, set to be directed by Elizabeth Banks and rumored to star Kristen Stewart and Lupita Nyong'o, Barrymore was supportive of the idea.\n\n\"I'm just excited for them,\" the Santa Clarita Diet star said. \"Because every generation that brings Charlie's Angels out into the world is about the power of three women and what they can do, while loving men and wanting to date them or working side by side with them. But there's just something about Charlie's Angels that make men and women so happy.\"\n\n\"And it's so positive.

She wants to speak to her dad.\"\n\nTom has never actually given a reason as to why he no longer sees his youngest child.",

        "text": "Brad Pitt\n\nThe one that got away. For both, perhaps?\n\n\"I f--ked that up, Brad,\" Paltrow said on the Girlboss Radio podcast when host Sophia Amoruso mentioned Gwyneth's great love of the mid-'to-late-90s, whom she met in 1994 on the set of the thriller Se7en, playing his ill-fated wife.\n\nWhen he won a Golden Globe for 12 Monkeys in 1996, Pitt's final thank you was reserved for \"especially the love o' my life, my angel, Gwyneth Paltrow.\" They got engaged, they even got matching haircuts, but then they broke up in June 1997.\n\nPaltrow has been relentless in blaming herself for the demise of their relationship, telling Diane Sawyer in 2003, \"I'm so lucky that I spent time with Brad, somebody who was such a good person! Especially when I was, like, such a mess.\" Admittedly the relentless media attention—which peaked when long-lens nude photos of the couple taken while they were vacationing in the Caribbean ended up online—really got to her then, understandably so.\n\n\"My kind of internal stuff really tripped up that whole relationship,\" Paltrow said. \"And I felt really responsible, and also like I was the architect of my own misery...I just made a big mess out of it.''\n\nThe actress told Howard Stern in 2015 that her beloved father, Bruce Paltrow, who died in 2002, \"adored him like a son.\" But \"I was such a kid, I was 22 when we met. It's taken me until 40 to get my head out of my ass. You can't make that decision when you're 22 years old...I wasn't ready, and he was too good for me.\"\n\nOnly recently did Paltrow tell the New York Times that she too was subject to unwanted advances from alleged serial predator Harvey Weinstein roughly 20 years ago, when she was dating Pitt—and that Pitt confronted Weinstein at an event afterward, warning the producer that something like that had best never happen again. So there was more going on at the time for Paltrow to process than anyone publicly knew about for decades.\n\nBy the time of the Sawyer sit-down, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston. \"We're able to sort of see each other and smile and wish each other well,\" Paltrow said.",

        "text": "It seems Julia Roberts and Danny Moder may be headed for divorce. When the actress took the part of a worker at a secret government facility on Homecoming, an upcoming political thriller on Amazon, she knew just who she wanted as her co-star: her old pal Dermot Mulroney.\n\nShe lobbied for him to join the show, and on March 8, it was officially announced that Dermot, 54 — who starred with Julia in My Best Friend’s Wedding and August: Osage County — would play her character’s boyfriend.\n\nJulia and Dermot.\n\nShe was thrilled. Her husband? Furious. “Julia’s reunion with Dermot hasn’t gone down well with Danny,” an insider tells Life & Style. “Even though Julia’s reminded him that Dermot is happily married with children, Danny’s jealous.”\n\nIt’s just one of many issues causing problems in Julia and Danny’s marriage. The cameraman and cinematographer “is at the end of his rope,” the insider tells Life & Style. “Julia and Danny are constantly quarreling. Their 15-year marriage is on the rocks, and they could even split.”\n\nJulia and Danny have been drifting apart for years. “Her controlling ways, their different approaches to parenting, and his desire to have his own career, and be the man of the house have all contributed to arguments,” says the insider. But recently, things have gotten worse. “They have been living separate lives,” the insider notes\n\nJulia, Danny, and their three kids in August 2015.\n\nInstead of focusing on repairing his marriage to Julia, 50, Danny, 49, “has been devoting his time to the kids [twins Hazel and Finn, 13, and son Henry, 10], friends, and jobs away from his wife.” When he’s home, the insider says, he often stays across the street from their beachfront compound, in a house they bought in 2016 that was originally meant for guests or nannies. The rift is only continuing to grow. “Julia is a super-protective parent, which has caused friction with Danny, who believes in being more relaxed,” explains the insider.\n\nBut when it comes to other men, he’s anything but. When Julia called hunky survivalist Bear Grylls “a man’s man” after they completed a charity trek across Africa together in 2017, “that really got under Danny’s skin,” says the insider. Danny was also seething after his wife turned into what he called a fawning “sports groupie,” the insider says, when they spent time with British and Spanish soccer stars at meet-and-greets in 2016 and 2017.\n\nDanny’s insecurity extends to his career, too: He hates being seen as Mr. Julia Roberts. “For a long time, Danny viewed Julia’s success as his own failure. It triggered a fear that he was not good enough, and the fact that Julia controls everything at home made it worse,” explains the insider. “Feeling insecure and competitive with your partner is no way to live.”\n\nThough they love each other, friends fear they can’t go on like this much longer. “Julia and Danny’s marriage is hanging by a thread,” says the insider. “Unless they can come to terms with their issues, they’re headed for divorce.”",

        "text": "Vera Anderson/WireImage, Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nLopez and Affleck called off their engagement in early 2004, just before their wedding. Weeks later, Lopez reunited with ex Marc Anthony and the two wed after several months and later welcomed twins, Max and Emme, who are now 8. Lopez and Anthony split in 2011. That year, she started dating backup dancer Casper Smart, 28.\n\nAffleck went on to date his Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner. The two wed in 2005 and had three children, Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7 and Samuel, 4. The couple announced last June they planned to divorce. No papers have been filed.\n\nIn 2014, Lopez said on the Today show her and Affleck's split was probably her \"first big heartbreak.\" In 2015, she told HuffPost Live she had \"no regrets\" about her time with the actor. A month after she spoke to HuffPost Live, Lopez and Affleck reunited briefly at the Oscars.\n\n\"I would do it all over again, I think. I really would. Even the relationship part,\" she told the outlet. \"I just feel like everything is part of your story and your journey and is meant to be and helps you grow if you're willing to look at it, and I'm willing to look.\"\n\nAffleck told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012 he keeps in touch Lopez, as well as other ex-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow and his high school sweetheart, Cheyenne Rothman.\n\n\"We don't have the kind of relationship where she relies on me for advice,\" he said about Lopez, \"but we do have the kind of relationship where there'll be an e-mail saying, 'Oh, your movie looks great.' I remember when she got American Idol. I said, 'This was really smart. Good luck.'\"\n\n\"I touch base,\" he said. \"I respect her. I like her. She's put up with some stuff that was unfair in her life, and I'm really pleased to see her successful.\"",

        "text": "\n\nThey can no longer even pretend to make it work. For years, it’s been rumored that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have had troubles in their marriage — but an insider tells In Touch exclusively that the pair, who have been married since 2008, are officially at their breaking point, and divorce is officially inevitable.\n\n“They’re not going to make it. Their roller-coaster marriage is about to derail,” the insider tells the magazine.\n\nThe reason they have held off until this point isn’t a coincidence: Next August marks 10 years since they tied the knot, and after making it a decade together, California law could mean Portia is entitled to more of Ellen’s money (Ellen is worth an estimated $360 million, compared to Portia’s $20 million fortune). Should Ellen want to protect herself (and her estate), she would need to end their union before the big anniversary come August. But it’s unlikely that that’ll happen — as Ellen was the one hoping to make things work. The insider adds, “[Ellen’s] friends know she would do whatever it takes to stay married to Portia, and she has. They’ve gone to individual and couples counseling.”\n\nOf course, it isn’t surprising that Ellen, 59, isn’t as keen to divorce as her wife, 44; according to the insider, her controllng ways played a huge role in their crumbling relationship. “Ellen is a control freak, and she prety much micromanages Portia’s personal and professional life,” the insider explains, adding that Portia is far from innocent. “Ellen is tired of being told to change this and change that about herself. It’s a sad situation. Ellen doesn’t want to get a divorce. She’s a romantic.”\n\nWith the potential trouble looming around the “10-year rule,” as it’s known informally in California, the legal battle looming ahead is likely to be an ugly one. And the personal battle will be just as ugly for their loved ones and fans. The insider laments, “No one wants to see them split up.”\n\nFor more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter!",
